{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21234", "CVE_Description": "spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple logfile viewer as spring boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package \"eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview\". In spring-boot-actuator-logview before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal vulnerability. The nature of this library is to expose a log file directory via admin (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the filename to view and a base folder (relative to the logging folder root) can be specified via request parameters. While the filename parameter was checked to prevent directory traversal exploits (so that `filename=../somefile` would not work), the base folder parameter was not sufficiently checked, so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could access a file outside the logging base directory). The vulnerability has been patched in release 0.2.13. Any users of 0.2.12 should be able to update without any issues as there are no other changes in that release. There is no workaround to fix the vulnerability other than updating or removing the dependency. However, removing read access of the user the application is run with to any directory not required for running the application can limit the impact. Additionally, access to the logview endpoint can be limited by deploying the application behind a reverse proxy.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.7 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/lukashinsch/spring-boot-actuator-logview/commit/1c76e1ec3588c9f39e1a94bf27b5ff56eb8b17d6": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/lukashinsch/spring-boot-actuator-logview/commit/760acbb939a8d1f7d1a7dfcd51ca848eea04e772": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/lukashinsch/spring-boot-actuator-logview/security/advisories/GHSA-p4q6-qxjx-8jgp": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://search.maven.org/artifact/eu.hinsch/spring-boot-actuator-logview": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"}}

However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address `0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0` (or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in version 4.5.2.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21261", "CVE_Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name `org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the `flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance. A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal` service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "8.8 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.3 HIGH"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6d1773d2a54dde9b099043f07a2094a4f1c2f486": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/6e5ae7a109cdfa9735ea7ccbd8cb79f9e8d3ae8b": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/aeb6a7ab0abaac4a8f4ad98b3df476d9de6b8bd4": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/cc1401043c075268ecc652eac557ef8076b5eaba": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/1.8.5": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-4ppf-fxf6-vxg2": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202101-21": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4830": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-74": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')"}}

Weave Net is supplied with a manifest that runs pods on every node in a Kubernetes cluster, which are responsible for managing network connections for all other pods in the cluster. This requires a lot of power over the host, and the manifest sets `privileged: true`, which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it the ability to access all other processes on the host, and write anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting was not necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the hostPID setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21272", "CVE_Description": "ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.7 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases/tag/v0.9.0": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/oras": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21271", "CVE_Description": "Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still “in flight” when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn’t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different “last commits” when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "6.5 MEDIUM", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.3/CHANGELOG.md#v0.34.3": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/a2a6852ab99e4a0f9e79f0ea8c1726e262e25c76": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-p658-8693-mhvg": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-400": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21283", "CVE_Description": "Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The \"Flarum Sticky\" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky extension.
