The Datadog API is executed on a unix-like system with multiple users. The API is used to download a file containing sensitive information. This sensitive information is exposed locally to other users. This vulnerability exists in the API Client for version 1 and 2. The method `prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of `-rw-r--r--` on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded via the `downloadFileFromResponse` method will be visible to all other users on the local system. Analysis of the finding determined that the affected code was unused, meaning that the exploitation likelihood is low. The unused code has been removed, effectively mitigating this issue. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.0-beta.9.

In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause the processing of other valid requests to fail.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21381", "CVE_Description": "Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and before version 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in the \"file forwarding\" feature which can be used by an attacker to gain access to files that would not ordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions. By putting the special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak app's .desktop file, a malicious app publisher can trick flatpak into behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file with their Flatpak app, which automatically makes that file available to the Flatpak app. This is fixed in version 1.10.2. A minimal solution is the first commit \"`Disallow @@ and @@U usage in desktop files`\". The follow-up commits \"`dir: Reserve the whole @@ prefix`\" and \"`dir: Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@ tokens`\" are recommended, but not strictly required. As a workaround, avoid installing Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, or check the contents of the exported `.desktop` files in `exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically `~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and `/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure that literal filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "8.2 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.1 HIGH"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/8279c5818425b6812523e3805bbe242fb6a5d961": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/a7401e638bf0c03102039e216ab1081922f140ae": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/commit/eb7946bb6248923d8c90fe9b84425fef97ae580d": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/pull/4156": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/releases/tag/1.10.2": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/security/advisories/GHSA-xgh4-387p-hqpp": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2MXXLXC2DPJ45HSMTI5MZYHMYEGQN6AA/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WXNVFOIB6ZP4DGOVKAM25T6OIEP3YLGV/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4868": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-74": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21367", "CVE_Description": "Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default, elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data from such services without authorization. If no such services have been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...) to control the device. As such, users should check the list of trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all, and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g. `bluetoothctl` CLI).", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "8.1 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "6.1 MEDIUM"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/commit/86500e645a907538abafe5225b67cc12c03e7645": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/releases/tag/2.3.5": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-bluetooth/security/advisories/GHSA-5p3g-j69g-w2mq": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AV7WKO5SZHTF3QEMX4WZ576HRECIG6VQ/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/O7TCGM4B45VLUJDCE5PHFYA5KBNHD4RA/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SWUPPVFG76PXQA3AHSGKYPRMVZ5AYHZI/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-863": "Incorrect Authorization"}}
{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-21368", "CVE_Description": "msgpack5 is a msgpack v5 implementation for node.js and the browser. In msgpack5 before versions 3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1 there is a \"Prototype Poisoning\" vulnerability. When msgpack5 decodes a map containing a key \"__proto__\", it assigns the decoded value to __proto__. Object.prototype.__proto__ is an accessor property for the receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to the key __proto__ decodes to an object or null, msgpack5 sets the decoded object's prototype to that value. An attacker who can submit crafted MessagePack data to a service can use this to produce values that appear to be of other types; may have unexpected prototype properties and methods (for example length, numeric properties, and push et al if __proto__'s value decodes to an Array); and/or may throw unexpected exceptions when used (for example if the __proto__ value decodes to a Map or Date). Other unexpected behavior might be produced for other types. There is no effect on the global prototype. This \"prototype poisoning\" is sort of a very limited inversion of a prototype pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is affected, and it can only be set to msgpack5 values (though if the victim makes use of custom codecs, anything could be a msgpack5 value). We have not found a way to escalate this to true prototype pollution (absent other bugs in the consumer's code). This has been fixed in msgpack5 version 3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-3450", "CVE_Description": "The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \"purpose\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \"purpose\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose.
