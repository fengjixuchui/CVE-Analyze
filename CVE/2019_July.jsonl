The user connects to this open Wireless network and uses the web management interface of the device to provide the user's Wi-Fi credentials so that the device can connect to it and have Internet access. This device acts as a Wireless Blood pressure monitor and is used to measure blood pressure levels of a person. This allows an attacker who is in vicinity of Wireless signal generated by the Blipcare device to easily sniff the credentials. Also, an attacker can connect to the open wireless network \"Blip\" exposed by the device and modify the HTTP response presented to the user by the device to execute other attacks such as convincing the user to download and execute a malicious binary that would infect a user's computer or mobile device with malware.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.1 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N"}, "Reference": {"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153225/Blipcare-Clear-Text-Communication-Memory-Corruption.html": ["Third Party Advisory", "VDB Entry"], "https://github.com/ethanhunnt/IoT_vulnerabilities/blob/master/Blipcare_sec_issues.pdf": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/8": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-254": "7PK - Security Features"}}

When connected to the \"Blip\" open wireless connection provided by the device, if a large string is sent as a part of the HTTP request in any part of the HTTP headers, the device could become completely unresponsive. Presumably this happens as the memory footprint provided to this device is very small. According to the specs from Rezolt, the Wi-Fi module only has 256k of memory. As a result, an incorrect string copy operation using either memcpy, strcpy, or any of their other variants could result in filling up the memory space allocated to the function executing and this would result in memory corruption. To test the theory, one can modify the demo application provided by the Cypress WICED SDK and introduce an incorrect \"memcpy\" operation and use the compiled application on the evaluation board provided by Cypress semiconductors with exactly the same Wi-Fi SOC.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-10639", "CVE_Description": "The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}, "Reference": {"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00014.html": [], "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-07/msg00025.html": [], "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10478.pdf": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.0.8": ["Mailing List", "Release Notes", "Vendor Advisory"], "https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=355b98553789b646ed97ad801a619ff898471b92": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Vendor Advisory"], "https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/355b98553789b646ed97ad801a619ff898471b92": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/07/msg00022.html": [], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00017.html": [], "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Aug/18": [], "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190806-0001/": [], "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K32804955": [], "https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K32804955?utm_source=f5support&amp;utm_medium=RSS": [], "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4115-1/": [], "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4118-1/": [], "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4497": [], "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html": []}, "CWE": {"CWE-326": "Inadequate Encryption Strength"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-1552", "CVE_Description": "OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can find a configuration file as well as certificates used for verification in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR, and is configurable with the --prefix / --openssldir configuration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0 and 1.1.1, the mingw configuration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed in a Unix-like environment and the default prefix for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR should be '/usr/local'. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, find themselves looking at sub-directories of 'C:/usr/local', which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users to modify OpenSSL's default configuration, insert CA certificates, modify (or even replace) existing engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, '/usr/local/ssl' is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own --prefix. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this has been assessed as low severity and therefore we are not creating new releases at this time. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
