This first genuine packet received and inspected by sampled flow (sFlow) through a specific firewall policer will cause the device to reboot. After the reboot has completed, if the device receives and sFlow inspects another genuine packet seen through a specific firewall policer, the device will generate a core file and reboot. Continued inspection of these genuine packets will create an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition.

Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P connection requests. For each p2p connection, it allocates XXX bytes. Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint does not reclaim activeID of a peer after it's removed in Mempool reactor. This does not happen all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason) before the Peer is created and added to all reactors. RemovePeer is therefore called before AddPeer, which leads to always growing memory (activeIDs map). The activeIDs map has a maximum size of 65535 and the node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting above denial of service), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking.

The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links. “1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such, the description stating ‘An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong) through 2.0.3.’ is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to a documentation improvement as a “Patch” link: https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-proofing.

The read-write unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding ones. In other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor before all the memory accesses within the \"critical\" section. As a consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words, many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable cannot be modified after a check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is a small window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.8 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00006.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/14/2": ["Mailing List", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html": ["Patch", "Vendor Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5M2XRNCHOGGTJQBZQJ7DCV6ZNAKN3LE2/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NVTP4OYHCTRU3ONFJOFJQVNDFB25KLLG/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/YMAW7D2MP6RE4BFI5BZWOBBWGY3VSOFN/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202005-08": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4723": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-314.html": ["Patch", "Vendor Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-362": "Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-5260", "CVE_Description": "Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4, 2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "9.3 CRITICAL"}, "Reference": {"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00027.html": ["Third Party Advisory"], "http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html": ["Third Party Advisory"], "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/157250/Git-Credential-Helper-Protocol-Newline-Injection.html": ["Third Party Advisory", "VDB Entry"], "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/5": ["Mailing List"], "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/15/6": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/20/1": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/git/git/commit/9a6bbee8006c24b46a85d29e7b38cfa79e9ab21b": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q": ["Mitigation", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00010.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7TVS5UG6JD3MYIGSBKMIOS6AF7CR5IPI/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XPCEOIFLLEF24L6GLVJVFZX4CREDEHDF/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqqy2qy7xn8.fsf@gitster.c.googlers.com/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211141": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4329-1/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4657": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-522": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE-20": "Improper Input Validation"}}

The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected Request. Imagine a shared caching forward proxy re-using an HTTP/2 connection for a large subnet with many users. If a victim is interacting with abc.example.com, and a server (for abc.example.com) recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server. This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error.

There is also support in the Saml2 protocol for issuing tokens that is tied to a subject through other means, e.g. holder-of-key where possession of a private key must be proved. The Sustainsys.Saml2 library incorrectly treats all incoming tokens as bearer tokens, even though they have another subject confirmation method specified. This could be used by an attacker that could get access to Saml2 tokens with another subject confirmation method than bearer. The attacker could then use such a token to create a log in session.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2020-11008", "CVE_Description": "Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q). The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where _some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which one). Git uses external \"credential helper\" programs to store and retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to send a \"blank\" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's \"store\" helper - Git's \"cache\" helper - the \"osxkeychain\" helper that ships in Git's \"contrib\" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the vulnerability.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "4.0 MEDIUM"}, "Reference": {"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00003.html": [], "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/May/41": [], "https://github.com/git/git/commit/c44088ecc4b0722636e0a305f9608d3047197282": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-hjc9-x69f-jqj7": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q": ["Mitigation", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/04/msg00015.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/74Q7WVJ6FKLIN62VS2JD2XCNWK5TNKOW/": [], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MOCTR2SEHCPSCOVUQJAGFPGKFMI2VE6V/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PN3FUOXKX3AXTULYV53ACABER2W2FSOU/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202004-13": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT211183": [], "https://usn.ubuntu.com/4334-1/": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-522": "Insufficiently Protected Credentials", "CWE-20": "Improper Input Validation"}}

If someone requests a path ending with e.g. `.PHP` and the server is serving the code from a case-insensitive file system, such as on Windows, the processing of the PHP code does not occur, and the source code is instead presented to the browser. An attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in third-party modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive.

It is able to lookup resources in the cluster to check for the existence of specific resources and get details about them. This can be used as part of the process to render templates. The documented behavior of `helm template` states that it does not attach to a remote cluster. However, a the recently added `lookup` template function circumvents this restriction and connects to the cluster even during `helm template` and `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-run`. The user is not notified of this behavior. Running `helm template` should not make calls to a cluster. This is different from `install`, which is presumed to have access to a cluster in order to load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 is unaffected by this vulnerability. A malicious chart author could inject a `lookup` into a chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performs unannounced lookups against the cluster a user&#39;s `KUBECONFIG` file points to.
