{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-43784", "CVE_Description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container.

Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git).", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/releases/tag/2.5.254": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/Requarks/wiki/security/advisories/GHSA-r363-73gj-6j25": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-41090", "CVE_Description": "Grafana Agent is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack. Prior to versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2, inline secrets defined within a metrics instance config are exposed in plaintext over two endpoints: metrics instance configs defined in the base YAML file are exposed at `/-/config` and metrics instance configs defined for the scraping service are exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/:key`. Inline secrets will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints. If HTTPS with client authentication is not configured, these endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users. Secrets found in these sections are used for delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system, authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets, and authenticating against a system for collecting metrics. This does not apply for non-inlined secrets, such as `*_file` based secrets. This issue is patched in Grafana Agent versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2. A few workarounds are available. Users who cannot upgrade should use non-inline secrets where possible. Users may also desire to restrict API access to Grafana Agent with some combination of restricting the network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through `http_listen_address` in the `server` block, configuring Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication, and/or using firewall rules to restrict external access to Grafana Agent's API.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "6.5 MEDIUM"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/grafana/agent/commit/af7fb01e31fe2d389e5f1c36b399ddc46b412b21": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/1152": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.20.1": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.21.2": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/grafana/agent/security/advisories/GHSA-9c4x-5hgq-q3wh": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211229-0004/": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-312": "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information", "CWE-200": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-43809", "CVE_Description": "`Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "7.3 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "6.7 MEDIUM"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/0fad1ccfe9dd7a3c5b82c1496df3c2b4842870d3": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/a4f2f8ac17e6ce81c689527a8b6f14381060d95f": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5142": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/security/advisories/GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-88": "Improper Neutralization of Argument Delimiters in a Command ('Argument Injection')"}}

This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state.

By providing a filename that contains a relative path as a parameter in some REST methods, it is possible to create directory structures and write files anywhere on the target system. The attack could be used to write files anywhere in the web root folder or outside, depending on the configuration of the system and the properly configured permission of the application server user. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account, an enabled REST API and the rights on a business object to call the vulnerable REST calls. The problem is fixed in version 15.5.12 and 16.0.5. There is a workaround available. The vulnerability requires the REST module to be enabled. Disabling the REST module or limiting the REST module via some firewall or web-server access rules to be accessed only be trusted systems will mitigate the risk.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "8.1 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/336d5ce80681be61a0bbf4f73d2af5d1ff67e93a": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/commit/c450df7d7ffe6afde39ebca6da9136f1caa16ec4": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/OpenOLAT/OpenOLAT/security/advisories/GHSA-62hv-rfp4-hmrm": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://jira.openolat.org/browse/OO-5819": ["Permissions Required", "Vendor Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-23": "Relative Path Traversal"}}

Sourcegraph prior to version 3.33.2 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack where strings in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but unauthorized actor. This issue affects the Saved Searches and Code Monitoring features. A successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create many Saved Searches or Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in version 3.33.2 and any future versions of Sourcegraph.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-41272", "CVE_Description": "Besu is an Ethereum client written in Java. Starting in version 21.10.0, changes in the implementation of the SHL, SHR, and SAR operations resulted in the introduction of a signed type coercion error in values that represent negative values for 32 bit signed integers. Smart contracts that ask for shifts between approximately 2 billion and 4 billion bits (nonsensical but valid values for the operation) will fail to execute and hence fail to validate. In networks where vulnerable versions are mining with other clients or non-vulnerable versions this will result in a fork and the relevant transactions will not be included in the fork. In networks where vulnerable versions are not mining (such as Rinkeby) no fork will result and the validator nodes will stop accepting blocks. In networks where only vulnerable versions are mining the relevant transaction will not be included in any blocks. When the network adds a non-vulnerable version the network will act as in the first case. Besu 21.10.2 contains a patch for this issue. Besu 21.7.4 is not vulnerable and clients can roll back to that version.

That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-43837", "CVE_Description": "vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0 vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist. Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag `--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g. `vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use: `vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates securely.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "9.1 CRITICAL", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "8.4 HIGH"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/peopledoc/vault-cli/commit/3ba3955887fd6b7d4d646c8b260f21cebf5db852": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/peopledoc/vault-cli/security/advisories/GHSA-q34h-97wf-8r8j": ["Exploit", "Mitigation", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://podalirius.net/en/publications/grehack-2021-optimizing-ssti-payloads-for-jinja2/": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-74": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')"}}

MSEdgeRedirect versions before 0.5.0.1 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via specifically crafted URLs. This vulnerability requires user interaction and the acceptance of a prompt. With how MSEdgeRedirect is coded, parameters are impossible to pass to any launched file. However, there are two possible scenarios in which an attacker can do more than a minor annoyance. In Scenario 1 (confirmed), a user visits an attacker controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and downloads, an executable payload; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and RCE executes the payload the user previously downloaded, if the download path is successfully guessed. In Scenario 2 (not yet confirmed), a user visits an attacked controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and a payload on a remote, attacker controlled, SMB server is executed. The issue was found in the _DecodeAndRun() function, in which I incorrectly assumed _WinAPI_UrlIs() would only accept web resources. Unfortunately, file:/// passes the default _WinAPI_UrlIs check(). File paths are now directly checked for and must fail. There is no currently known exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-43842", "CVE_Description": "Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit 5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the first production version to contain a patch.

Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/nltk/nltk/commit/1405aad979c6b8080dbbc8e0858f89b2e3690341": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/issues/2866": ["Exploit", "Issue Tracking", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/pull/2869": ["Exploit", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/nltk/nltk/security/advisories/GHSA-f8m6-h2c7-8h9x": ["Exploit", "Patch", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-400": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}}
