Two different patches are provided: - a first one to fix the CSRF problem - a more complex one that now relies on sending an email for the Forgot username process. ### Workarounds It's possible to fix the problem without uprading by editing the ForgotUsername page in version below 13.x, to use the following code: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/blob/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf/xwiki-platform-core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ForgotUsername.xml#L39-L123 In version after 13.x it's also possible to edit manually the forgotusername.vm file, but it's really encouraged to upgrade the version here. ### References * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384 * https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408 ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org) * Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "6.5 MEDIUM", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N", "CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f0440dfcbba705e03f7565cd88893dde57ca3fa8": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-vh5c-jqfg-mhrh": ["Mitigation", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18384": ["Exploit", "Patch", "Vendor Advisory"], "https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18408": ["Exploit", "Patch", "Vendor Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-352": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-21702", "CVE_Description": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In affected versions an attacker could serve HTML content thru the Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana instance. To be impacted, all of the following must be applicable. For the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with Server as Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL of above datasource, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source must be clicked on by an authenticated user.

In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot `A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification loophole.

Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "7.5 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/962": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/pull/987": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/releases/tag/v1.11.1": ["Release Notes", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang/security/advisories/GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p": ["Issue Tracking", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2IK53GWZ475OQ6ENABKMJMTOBZG6LXUR/": [], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2PFW6Q2LXXWTFRTMTRN4ZGADFRQPKJ3D/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/36GUEPA5TPSC57DZTPYPBL6T7UPQ2FRH/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4KDETHL5XCT6RZN2BBNOCEXRZ2W3SFU3/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7V7I72LSQ3IET3QJR6QPAVGJZ4CBDLN5/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AK7CJBCGERCRXYUR2EWDSSDVAQMTAZGX/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DLUJZV3HBP56ADXU6QH2V7RNYUPMVBXQ/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/FY3N7H6VSDZM37B4SKM2PFFCUWU7QYWN/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/HLAQRRGNSO5MYCPAXGPH2OCSHOGHSQMQ/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/J5WPM42UR6XIBQNQPNQHM32X7S4LJTRX/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KBMVIQFKQDSSTHVVJWJ4QH6TW3JVB7XZ/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MH6ALXEQXIFQRQFNJ5Y2MJ5DFPIX76VN/": [], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SASRKYHT5ZFSVMJUQUG3UAEQRJYGJKAR/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZKORFJTRRDJCWBTJPISKKCVMMMJBIRLG/": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZY2SLWOQR4ZURQ7UBRZ7JIX6H6F5JHJR/": []}, "CWE": {"CWE-772": "Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime", "CWE-400": "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-23636", "CVE_Description": "Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue. Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing `false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`.

If these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is copied to a different signature, verification should fail.

This is particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are no known workarounds to this issue.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-23651", "CVE_Description": "b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe. The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info, ~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it.

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2022-23653", "CVE_Description": "B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2 command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition. The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping) in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`, `~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2 authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2 clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.", "CVE_Score": {"CNA:": "GitHub, Inc.", "CNA:Base Score:": "4.7 MEDIUM", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N"}, "Reference": {"https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool/commit/c74029f9f75065e8f7e3c3ec8e0a23fb8204feeb": ["Patch", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://github.com/Backblaze/B2_Command_Line_Tool/security/advisories/GHSA-8wr4-2wm6-w3pr": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-367": "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"}}
