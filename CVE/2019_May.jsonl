This vulnerability affects multiple Cisco products that support hardware-based Secure Boot functionality. The vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages on-premise updates to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) part of the Secure Boot hardware implementation. An attacker with elevated privileges and access to the underlying operating system that is running on the affected device could exploit this vulnerability by writing a modified firmware image to the FPGA. A successful exploit could either cause the device to become unusable (and require a hardware replacement) or allow tampering with the Secure Boot verification process, which under some circumstances may allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image. An attacker will need to fulfill all the following conditions to attempt to exploit this vulnerability: Have privileged administrative access to the device. Be able to access the underlying operating system running on the device; this can be achieved either by using a supported, documented mechanism or by exploiting another vulnerability that would provide an attacker with such access. Develop or have access to a platform-specific exploit. An attacker attempting to exploit this vulnerability across multiple affected platforms would need to research each one of those platforms and then develop a platform-specific exploit.

According to the OpenPGP Message Format specification in RFC 4880 chapter 7, a cleartext signed message can contain one or more optional \"Hash\" Armor Headers. The \"Hash\" Armor Header specifies the message digest algorithm(s) used for the signature. However, the Go clearsign package ignores the value of this header, which allows an attacker to spoof it. Consequently, an attacker can lead a victim to believe the signature was generated using a different message digest algorithm than what was actually used. Moreover, since the library skips Armor Header parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating the signatures.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "5.9 MEDIUM", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N"}, "Reference": {"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152840/Go-Cryptography-Libraries-Cleartext-Message-Spoofing.html": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory", "VDB Entry"], "https://go.googlesource.com/crypto/": ["Product", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/09/msg00011.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/10/msg00014.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://sec-consult.com/": ["Third Party Advisory"], "https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/advisories/cleartext-message-spoofing-in-go-cryptography-libraries-cve-2019-11841/": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-347": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature"}}

{"CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-11231", "CVE_Description": "An issue was discovered in GetSimple CMS through 3.3.15. insufficient input sanitation in the theme-edit.php file allows upload of files with arbitrary content (PHP code, for example). This vulnerability is triggered by an authenticated user; however, authentication can be bypassed. According to the official documentation for installation step 10, an admin is required to upload all the files, including the .htaccess files, and run a health check. However, what is overlooked is that the Apache HTTP Server by default no longer enables the AllowOverride directive, leading to data/users/admin.xml password exposure. The passwords are hashed but this can be bypassed by starting with the data/other/authorization.xml API key. This allows one to target the session state, since they decided to roll their own implementation. The cookie_name is crafted information that can be leaked from the frontend (site name and version). If a someone leaks the API key and the admin username, then they can bypass authentication. To do so, they need to supply a cookie based on an SHA-1 computation of this known information. The vulnerability exists in the admin/theme-edit.php file. This file checks for forms submissions via POST requests, and for the csrf nonce. If the nonce sent is correct, then the file provided by the user is uploaded. There is a path traversal allowing write access outside the jailed themes directory root. Exploiting the traversal is not necessary because the .htaccess file is ignored. A contributing factor is that there isn't another check on the extension before saving the file, with the assumption that the parameter content is safe. This allows the creation of web accessible and executable files with arbitrary content.", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "9.8 CRITICAL", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152961/GetSimpleCMS-3.3.15-Remote-Code-Execution.html": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory", "VDB Entry"], "https://ssd-disclosure.com/?p=3899&preview=true": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"}}

The vulnerability allows for abusing the application for fraud or unauthorized access to certain information. The attack requires a valid user account to connect to the Blue Prism server, but the roles associated to this account are not required to have any permissions. First of all, the application files are modified to grant full permissions on the client side. In a test environment (or his own instance of the software) an attacker is able to grant himself full privileges also on the server side. He can then, for instance, create a process with malicious behavior and export it to disk. With the modified client, it is possible to import the exported file as a release and overwrite any existing process in the database. Eventually, the bots execute the malicious process. The server does not check the user's permissions for the aforementioned actions, such that a modification of the client software enables this kind of attack.

Horde/Form/Type.php contains a vulnerable class that handles image upload in forms. When the Horde_Form_Type_image method onSubmit() is called on uploads, it invokes the functions getImage() and _getUpload(), which uses unsanitized user input as a path to save the image. The unsanitized POST parameter object[photo][img][file] is saved in the $upload[img][file] PHP variable, allowing an attacker to manipulate the $tmp_file passed to move_uploaded_file() to save the uploaded file. By setting the parameter to (for example) ../usr/share/horde/static/bd.php, one can write a PHP backdoor inside the web root. The static/ destination folder is a good candidate to drop the backdoor because it is always writable in Horde installations. (The unsanitized POST parameter went probably unnoticed because it's never submitted by the forms, which default to securely using a random path.)", "CVE_Score": {"NIST:": "NVD", "NIST:Base Score:": "8.8 HIGH", "Vector:": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H"}, "Reference": {"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152476/Horde-Form-Shell-Upload.html": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory", "VDB Entry"], "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/06/msg00007.html": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Jun/31": ["Mailing List", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://ssd-disclosure.com/?p=3814&preview=true": ["Exploit", "Third Party Advisory"], "https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4468": ["Third Party Advisory"]}, "CWE": {"CWE-22": "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"}}
