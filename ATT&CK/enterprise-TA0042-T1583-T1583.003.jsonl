{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1583-T1583.003", "TTP_name": "Virtual Private Server", "Description": "Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1583.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1583", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "17 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0001": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001", "Axiom", "Axiom has used VPS hosting providers in targeting of intended victims.[2]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has acquired VPS infrastructure for use in malicious campaigns.[3]"], "G0125": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0125", "HAFNIUM", "HAFNIUM has operated from leased virtual private servers (VPS) in the United States.[4]"], "G0088": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0088", "TEMP.Veles", "TEMP.Veles has used Virtual Private Server (VPS) infrastructure.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Response Content": ["Once adversaries have provisioned a VPS (ex: for use as a command and control server), internet scans may reveal servers that adversaries have acquired.
