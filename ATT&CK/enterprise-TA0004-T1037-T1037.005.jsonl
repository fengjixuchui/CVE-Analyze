Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.[1]This is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by Launch Daemon), and thus the appropriate folder, /Library/StartupItems isnâ€™t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist), StartupParameters.plist, reside in the top-level directory.An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.[2] Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user.", "Property": {"ID": "T1037.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1037", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "15 January 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0283": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0283", "jRAT", "jRAT can list and manage startup entries.[3]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022", "Restrict File and Directory Permissions", "Since StartupItems are deprecated, preventing all users from writing to the /Library/StartupItems directory would prevent any startup items from getting registered."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments for logon scripts", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed files by unusual accounts outside of normal administration duties", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "File Modification": ["Monitor for changes made to files for unexpected modifications to /Library/StartupItem folder", "", "", ""], "Process Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed processes and/or command-lines that execute during the boot up process to check for unusual or unknown applications and behavior", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"]}}
