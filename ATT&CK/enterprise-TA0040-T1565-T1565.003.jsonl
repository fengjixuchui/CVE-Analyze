Adversaries may also conduct Change Default File Association and Masquerading to cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.", "Property": {"ID": "T1565.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1565", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, SYSTEM, User, root", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "02 March 2020", "Last Modified": "25 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0082": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "APT38", "APT38 has used DYEPACK.FOX to manipulate PDF data as it is accessed to remove traces of fraudulent SWIFT transactions from the data displayed to the end user.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030", "Network Segmentation", "Identify critical business and system processes that may be targeted by adversaries and work to isolate and secure those systems against unauthorized access and tampering."], "M1022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022", "Restrict File and Directory Permissions", "Prevent critical business and system processes from being replaced, overwritten, or reconfigured to load potentially malicious code."]}, "Detection": {"File Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "File Deletion": ["Monitor for unexpected deletion of a file in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity", "", "", ""], "File Metadata": ["Monitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/ower, permissions, etc that would aid in the manipulation of data to hide activity", "", "", ""], "File Modification": ["Monitor for unexpected files with manipulated data in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity", "", "", ""], "OS API Execution": ["Monitor for API calls associated with altering data.
