{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0005-T1055", "TTP_name": "Process Injection", "Description": "Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.", "Property": {"ID": "T1055", "Sub-techniques": "T1055.001, T1055.002, T1055.003, T1055.004, T1055.005, T1055.008, T1055.009, T1055.011, T1055.012, T1055.013, T1055.014, T1055.015", "Tactics": "Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Defense Bypassed": "Anti-virus, Application control", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-640", "Contributors": "Anastasios Pingios; Christiaan Beek, @ChristiaanBeek; Ryan Becwar", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0469": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0469", "ABK", "ABK has the ability to inject shellcode into svchost.exe.[1]"], "S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla can inject into known, vulnerable binaries on targeted hosts.[2]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 malware has injected a Cobalt Strike beacon into Rundll32.exe.[3]"], "G0067": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067", "APT37", "APT37 injects its malware variant, ROKRAT, into the cmd.exe process.[4]"], "G0096": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096", "APT41", "APT41 malware TIDYELF loaded the main WINTERLOVE component by injecting it into the iexplore.exe process.[5]"], "S0438": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0438", "Attor", "Attor's dispatcher can inject itself into running processes to gain higher privileges and to evade detection.[6]"], "S0347": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0347", "AuditCred", "AuditCred can inject code from files to other running processes.[7]"], "S0473": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0473", "Avenger", "Avenger has the ability to inject shellcode into svchost.exe.[1]"], "S0093": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0093", "Backdoor.Oldrea", "Backdoor.Oldrea injects itself into explorer.exe.[8][9]"], "S0534": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0534", "Bazar", "Bazar can inject code through calling VirtualAllocExNuma.[10]"], "S0470": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0470", "BBK", "BBK has the ability to inject shellcode into svchost.exe.[1]"], "S0348": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0348", "Cardinal RAT", "Cardinal RAT injects into a newly spawned process created from a native Windows executable.[11]"], "S0660": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0660", "Clambling", "Clambling can inject into the svchost.exe process for execution.[12]"], "G0080": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0080", "Cobalt Group", "Cobalt Group has injected code into trusted processes.[13]"], "S0154": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154", "Cobalt Strike", "Cobalt Strike can inject a variety of payloads into processes dynamically chosen by the adversary.[14][15]"], "S0695": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0695", "Donut", "Donut includes a subproject DonutTest to inject shellcode into a target process.[16]"], "S0024": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0024", "Dyre", "Dyre has the ability to directly inject its code into the web browser process.[17]"], "S0554": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0554", "Egregor", "Egregor can inject its payload into iexplore.exe process.[18]"], "S0363": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363", "Empire", "Empire contains multiple modules for injecting into processes, such as Invoke-PSInject.[19]"], "S0168": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0168", "Gazer", "Gazer injects its communication module into an Internet accessible process through which it performs C2.[20][21]"], "S0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0032", "gh0st RAT", "gh0st RAT can inject malicious code into process created by the \"Command_Create&Inject\" function.[22]"], "S0561": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0561", "GuLoader", "GuLoader has the ability to inject shellcode into a donor processes that is started in a suspended state.
