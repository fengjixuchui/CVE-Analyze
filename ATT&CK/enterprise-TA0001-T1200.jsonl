{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0001-T1200", "TTP_name": "Hardware Additions", "Description": "Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. Replication Through Removable Media), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. Adversary-in-the-Middle), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access to an existing network, and others.[1][2][3][4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1200", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-440", "Version": "1.6", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "28 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0105": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0105", "DarkVishnya", "DarkVishnya used Bash Bunny, Raspberry Pi, netbooks or inexpensive laptops to connect to the companyâ€™s local network.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035", "Limit Access to Resource Over Network", "Establish network access control policies, such as using device certificates and the 802.1x standard.
