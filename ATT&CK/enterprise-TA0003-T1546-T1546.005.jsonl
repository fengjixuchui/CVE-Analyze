The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism. Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where \"command list\" will be executed when \"signals\" are received.[1][2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1546.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1546", "Tactics": "Privilege Escalation, Persistence", "Platforms": "Linux, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, User", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "24 January 2020", "Last Modified": "24 March 2020"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed files that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "File Modification": ["Monitor for changes made to files that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.", "", "", ""], "Process Creation": ["Monitor newly executed processes that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"]}}
