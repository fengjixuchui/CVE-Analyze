Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as ftp. Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. Lateral Tool Transfer).Files can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system.[1]On Windows, adversaries may use various utilities to download tools, such as copy, finger, and PowerShell commands such as IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString() and Invoke-WebRequest. On Linux and macOS systems, a variety of utilities also exist, such as curl, scp, sftp, tftp, rsync, finger, and wget.[2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1105", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Command and Control", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "John Page (aka hyp3rlinx), ApparitionSec", "Version": "2.1", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "20 May 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0469": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0469", "ABK", "ABK has the ability to download files from C2.[3]"], "S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla can download additional files for execution on the victim’s machine.[4][5]"], "S0092": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0092", "Agent.btz", "Agent.btz attempts to download an encrypted binary from a specified domain.[6]"], "G0130": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0130", "Ajax Security Team", "Ajax Security Team has used Wrapper/Gholee, custom-developed malware, which downloaded additional malware to the infected system.[7]"], "S0504": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0504", "Anchor", "Anchor can download additional payloads.[8][9]"], "G0138": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138", "Andariel", "Andariel has downloaded additional tools and malware onto compromised hosts.[10]"], "G0099": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099", "APT-C-36", "APT-C-36 has downloaded binary data from a specified domain after the malicious document is opened.[11]"], "G0026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0026", "APT18", "APT18 can upload a file to the victim’s machine.[12]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has downloaded additional files, including by using a first-stage downloader to contact the C2 server to obtain the second-stage implant.[13][14][15][16][17]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has downloaded additional tools, such as TEARDROP malware and Cobalt Strike, to a compromised host following initial access.[18]"], "G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has a tool that can copy files to remote machines.[19]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has added JavaScript to victim websites to download additional frameworks that profile and compromise website visitors.[20]"], "G0064": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0064", "APT33", "APT33 has downloaded additional files and programs from its C2 server.[21][22]"], "G0067": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067", "APT37", "APT37 has downloaded second stage malware from compromised websites.[23][24][25][26]"], "G0082": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "APT38", "APT38 used a backdoor, NESTEGG, that has the capability to download and upload files to and from a victim’s machine.[27]"], "G0087": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087", "APT39", "APT39 has downloaded tools to compromised hosts.[28][29]"], "G0096": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096", "APT41", "APT41 used certutil to download additional files.[30][31][32]"], "G0143": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0143", "Aquatic Panda", "Aquatic Panda has downloaded additional malware onto compromised hosts.[33]"], "S0456": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0456", "Aria-body", "Aria-body has the ability to download additional payloads from C2.[34]"], "S0373": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0373", "Astaroth", "Astaroth uses certutil and BITSAdmin to download additional malware.
