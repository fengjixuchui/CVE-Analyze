{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0002-T1204-T1204.002", "TTP_name": "Malicious File", "Description": "An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Attachment. Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.Adversaries may employ various forms of Masquerading and Obfuscated Files or Information to increase the likelihood that a user will open and successfully execute a malicious file. These methods may include using a familiar naming convention and/or password protecting the file and supplying instructions to a user on how to open it.[1]While Malicious File frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after Internal Spearphishing.", "Property": {"ID": "T1204.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1204", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "TruKno", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "11 March 2020", "Last Modified": "20 May 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0018", "admin@338", "admin@338 has attempted to get victims to launch malicious Microsoft Word attachments delivered via spearphishing emails.[2]"], "S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla has been executed through malicious e-mail attachments [3]"], "G0130": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0130", "Ajax Security Team", "Ajax Security Team has lured victims into executing malicious files.[4]"], "G0138": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138", "Andariel", "Andariel has attempted to lure victims into enabling malicious macros within email attachments.[5]"], "S0584": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0584", "AppleJeus", "AppleJeus has required user execution of a malicious MSI installer.[6]"], "S0622": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0622", "AppleSeed", "AppleSeed can achieve execution through users running malicious file attachments distributed via email.[7]"], "G0099": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0099", "APT-C-36", "APT-C-36 has prompted victims to accept macros in order to execute the subsequent payload.[8]"], "G0005": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0005", "APT12", "APT12 has attempted to get victims to open malicious Microsoft Word and PDF attachment sent via spearphishing.[9][10]"], "G0073": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073", "APT19", "APT19 attempted to get users to launch malicious attachments delivered via spearphishing emails.[11]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 attempted to get users to click on Microsoft Office attachments containing malicious macro scripts.[12][13][14]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has used various forms of spearphishing attempting to get a user to open attachments, including, but not limited to, malicious Microsoft Word documents, .pdf, and .lnk files.
