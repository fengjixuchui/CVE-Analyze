Social media sites may contain various information about a victim organization, such as business announcements as well as information about the roles, locations, and interests of staff.Adversaries may search in different social media sites depending on what information they seek to gather. Threat actors may passively harvest data from these sites, as well as use information gathered to create fake profiles/groups to elicit victimâ€™s into revealing specific information (i.e. Spearphishing Service).[1] Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: Spearphishing via Service).", "Property": {"ID": "T1593.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1593", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has used Twitter to monitor potential victims and to prepare targeted phishing e-mails.[2]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has used LinkedIn to identify and target specific employees within a chosen organization.[3][4]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
