If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.", "Property": {"ID": "T1011.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1011", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "09 March 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0143": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0143", "Flame", "Flame has a module named BeetleJuice that contains Bluetooth functionality that may be used in different ways, including transmitting encoded information from the infected system over the Bluetooth protocol, acting as a Bluetooth beacon, and identifying other Bluetooth devices in the vicinity.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Disable Bluetooth in local computer security settings or by group policy if it is not needed within an environment."], "M1028": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1028", "Operating System Configuration", "Prevent the creation of new network adapters where possible."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Access": ["Monitor for files being accessed that could be related to exfiltration, such as file reads by a process that also has an active network connection.
