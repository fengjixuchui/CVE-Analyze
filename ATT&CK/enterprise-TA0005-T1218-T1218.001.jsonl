CHM files are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft HTML Help system.

[1] CHM content is displayed using underlying components of the Internet Explorer browser [2] loaded by the HTML Help executable program (hh.exe). [3]A custom CHM file containing embedded payloads could be delivered to a victim then triggered by User Execution. CHM execution may also bypass application application control on older and/or unpatched systems that do not account for execution of binaries through hh.exe.
