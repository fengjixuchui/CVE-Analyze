{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0005-T1222", "TTP_name": "File and Directory Permissions Modification", "Description": "Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.[1][2] File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).Modifications may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership of a file or directory and/or elevated permissions depending on the file or directoryâ€™s existing permissions. This may enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files or directories. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via Accessibility Features, Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts, Unix Shell Configuration Modification, or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via Hijack Execution Flow.", "Property": {"ID": "T1222", "Sub-techniques": "T1222.001, T1222.002", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, SYSTEM, User, root", "Defense Bypassed": "File system access controls", "Contributors": "CrowdStrike Falcon OverWatch; Jan Miller, CrowdStrike", "Version": "2.1", "Created": "17 October 2018", "Last Modified": "13 September 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Ensure critical system files as well as those known to be abused by adversaries have restrictive permissions and are owned by an appropriately privileged account, especially if access is not required by users nor will inhibit system functionality."], "M1022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022", "Restrict File and Directory Permissions", "Applying more restrictive permissions to files and directories could prevent adversaries from modifying the access control lists."]}, "Detection": {"Active Directory Object Modification": ["Monitor for changes made to ACLs and file/directory ownership.
