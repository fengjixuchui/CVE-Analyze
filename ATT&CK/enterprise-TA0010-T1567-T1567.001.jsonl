Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.", "Property": {"ID": "T1567.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1567", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "09 March 2020", "Last Modified": "28 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"S0363": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363", "Empire", "Empire can use GitHub for data exfiltration.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1021": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1021", "Restrict Web-Based Content", "Web proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed command and arguments that may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Access": ["Monitor for files being accessed to exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
