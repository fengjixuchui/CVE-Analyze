{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1584-T1584.005", "TTP_name": "Botnet", "Description": "Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.[1] Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems.[2] Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers.[3] With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale Phishing or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).", "Property": {"ID": "T1584.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1584", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0001": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001", "Axiom", "Axiom has used large groups of compromised machines for use as proxy nodes.[4]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has used a large-scale botnet to target Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) network devices.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {}}
