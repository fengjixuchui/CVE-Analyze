{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0011-T1219", "TTP_name": "Remote Access Software", "Description": "An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software, such as Team Viewer, AnyDesk, Go2Assist, LogMein, AmmyyAdmin, etc, to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks. These services are commonly used as legitimate technical support software, and may be allowed by application control within a target environment. Remote access tools like VNC, Ammyy, and Teamviewer are used frequently when compared with other legitimate software commonly used by adversaries.[1]Remote access tools may be installed and used post-compromise as alternate communications channel for redundant access or as a way to establish an interactive remote desktop session with the target system. They may also be used as a component of malware to establish a reverse connection or back-connect to a service or adversary controlled system. Installation of many remote access tools may also include persistence (ex: the tool's installation routine creates a Windows Service).Admin tools such as TeamViewer have been used by several groups targeting institutions in countries of interest to the Russian state and criminal campaigns.[2][3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1219", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Command and Control", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Matt Kelly, @breakersall; Zachary Stanford, @svch0st", "Version": "2.1", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "21 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030", "Carbanak", "Carbanak has a plugin for VNC and Ammyy Admin Tool.[4]"], "G0008": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0008", "Carbanak", "Carbanak used legitimate programs such as AmmyyAdmin and Team Viewer for remote interactive C2 to target systems.[5]"], "G0080": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0080", "Cobalt Group", "Cobalt Group used the Ammyy Admin tool as well as TeamViewer for remote access, including to preserve remote access if a Cobalt Strike module was lost.[6][7][8]"], "G0105": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0105", "DarkVishnya", "DarkVishnya used DameWare Mini Remote Control for lateral movement.[9]"], "S0384": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0384", "Dridex", "Dridex contains a module for VNC.[10]"], "S0554": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0554", "Egregor", "Egregor has checked for the LogMein event log in an attempt to encrypt files in remote machines.[11]"], "G0120": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0120", "Evilnum", "EVILNUM has used the malware variant, TerraTV, to run a legitimate TeamViewer application to connect to compromrised machines.[12]"], "G0115": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0115", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD has used the cloud-based remote management and monitoring tool \"ConnectWise Control\" to deploy REvil.[13]"], "S0601": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0601", "Hildegard", "Hildegard has established tmate sessions for C2 communications.[14]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has used a modified TeamViewer client as a command and control channel.[15][16]"], "G0069": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0069", "MuddyWater", "MuddyWater has used a legitimate application, ScreenConnect, to manage systems remotely and move laterally.[17][18]"], "G0129": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129", "Mustang Panda", "Mustang Panda has installed TeamViewer on targeted systems.[19]"], "G0014": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0014", "Night Dragon", "Night Dragon has used several remote administration tools as persistent infiltration channels.[20]"], "S0148": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0148", "RTM", "RTM has the capability to download a VNC module from command and control (C2).[21]"], "G0048": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0048", "RTM", "RTM has used a modified version of TeamViewer and Remote Utilities for remote access.[22]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has used remote administration tools or remote industrial control system client software to maliciously release electricity breakers.[23]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has established tmate sessions for C2 communications.[14]"], "G0076": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0076", "Thrip", "Thrip used a cloud-based remote access software called LogMeIn for their attacks.[24]"], "S0266": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266", "TrickBot", "TrickBot uses vncDll module to remote control the victim machine.[25][26]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038", "Execution Prevention", "Use application control to mitigate installation and use of unapproved software that can be used for remote access."], "M1037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037", "Filter Network Traffic", "Properly configure firewalls, application firewalls, and proxies to limit outgoing traffic to sites and services used by remote access tools."], "M1031": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031", "Network Intrusion Prevention", "Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures may be able to prevent traffic to remote access services."]}, "Detection": {"Network Connection Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.", "DS0029", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0029", "Network Traffic"], "Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
