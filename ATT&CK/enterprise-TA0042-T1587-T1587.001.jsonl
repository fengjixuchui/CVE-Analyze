{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1587-T1587.001", "TTP_name": "Malware", "Description": "Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. Building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.[1][2][3][4]As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing malware. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's malware development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the malware.Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure. For example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use of Web Services.[5]", "Property": {"ID": "T1587.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1587", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "14 January 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has leveraged numerous pieces of malware that appear to be unique to APT29 and were likely developed for or by the group.[6][7][8]"], "G0003": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0003", "Cleaver", "Cleaver has created customized tools and payloads for functions including ARP poisoning, encryption, credential dumping, ASP.NET shells, web backdoors, process enumeration, WMI querying, HTTP and SMB communications, network interface sniffing, and keystroke logging.[9]"], "G0046": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046", "FIN7", "FIN7 has developed malware for use in operations, including the creation of infected removable media.[4][10]"], "G0004": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0004", "Ke3chang", "Ke3chang has developed custom malware that allowed them to maintain persistence on victim networks.[11]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has developed its own unique malware such as MailFetch.py for use in operations.[12][13]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has developed custom malware for use in their operations.[14][15][16][17]"], "G0014": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0014", "Night Dragon", "Night Dragon used privately developed and customized remote access tools.[18]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has developed malware for its operations, including malicious mobile applications and destructive malware such as NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer.[19]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has developed custom malware such as Hildegard.[20]"], "G0010": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010", "Turla", "Turla has developed its own unique malware for use in operations.[21]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Malware Content": ["Consider analyzing malware for features that may be associated with the adversary and/or their developers, such as compiler used, debugging artifacts, or code similarities.
