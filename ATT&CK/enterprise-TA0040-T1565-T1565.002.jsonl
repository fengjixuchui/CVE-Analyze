The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.", "Property": {"ID": "T1565.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1565", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Impact Type": "Integrity", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "02 March 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0082": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "APT38", "APT38 has used DYEPACK to manipulate SWIFT messages en route to a printer.[1]"], "S0395": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0395", "LightNeuron", "LightNeuron is capable of modifying email content, headers, and attachments during transit.[3]"], "S0530": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0530", "Melcoz", "Melcoz can monitor the clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses and change the intended address to one controlled by the adversary.[4]"], "S0455": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0455", "Metamorfo", "Metamorfo has a function that can watch the contents of the system clipboard for valid bitcoin addresses, which it then overwrites with the attacker's address.[5][6]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1041": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041", "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Encrypt all important data flows to reduce the impact of tailored modifications on data in transit."]}, "Detection": {"Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor for networks that solicits and obtains the configuration information of the queried device.", "DS0029", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0029", "Network Traffic"], "Network Traffic Flow": ["Monitor for network traffic originating from unknown/unexpected hardware devices.", "", "", ""], "OS API Execution": ["Monitor for API calls associated with altering data.
