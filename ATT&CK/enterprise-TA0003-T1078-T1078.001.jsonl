{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0003-T1078-T1078.001", "TTP_name": "Default Accounts", "Description": "Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.[1][2][3]Default accounts are not limited to client machines, rather also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen Private Keys or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via Remote Services.[4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1078.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1078", "Tactics": "Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, User", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-70", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "13 March 2020", "Last Modified": "05 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0537": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0537", "HyperStack", "HyperStack can use default credentials to connect to IPC$ shares on remote machines.[5]"], "S0603": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0603", "Stuxnet", "Stuxnet infected WinCC machines via a hardcoded database server password.[6]"], "S0689": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0689", "WhisperGate", "The WhisperGate third stage can use the AdvancedRun.exe tool to execute commands in the context of the Windows TrustedInstaller group.[7]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027", "Password Policies", "Applications and appliances that utilize default username and password should be changed immediately after the installation, and before deployment to a production environment.
