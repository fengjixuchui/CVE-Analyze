In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a physical medium or device introduced by a user. Such media could be an external hard drive, USB drive, cellular phone, MP3 player, or other removable storage and processing device. The physical medium or device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.", "Property": {"ID": "T1052", "Sub-techniques": "T1052.001", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "System Requirements": "Presence of physical medium or device", "Contributors": "William Cain", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "15 October 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1057": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1057", "Data Loss Prevention", "Data loss prevention can detect and block sensitive data being copied to physical mediums."], "M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Disable Autorun if it is unnecessary.
