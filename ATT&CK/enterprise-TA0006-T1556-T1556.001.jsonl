Skeleton key works through a patch on an enterprise domain controller authentication process (LSASS) with credentials that adversaries may use to bypass the standard authentication system. Once patched, an adversary can use the injected password to successfully authenticate as any domain user account (until the the skeleton key is erased from memory by a reboot of the domain controller). Authenticated access may enable unfettered access to hosts and/or resources within single-factor authentication environments.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1556.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1556", "Tactics": "Credential Access, Defense Evasion, Persistence", "Platforms": "Windows", "Permissions Required": "Administrator", "Version": "2.0", "Created": "11 February 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0114": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0114", "Chimera", "Chimera's malware has altered the NTLM authentication program on domain controllers to allow Chimera to login without a valid credential.[2]"], "S0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0007", "Skeleton Key", "Skeleton Key is used to patch an enterprise domain controller authentication process with a backdoor password.
