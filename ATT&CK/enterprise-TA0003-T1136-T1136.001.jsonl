Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service. With a sufficient level of access, the net user /add command can be used to create a local account. On macOS systems the dscl -create command can be used to create a local account.Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.", "Property": {"ID": "T1136.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1136", "Tactic": "Persistence", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "28 January 2020", "Last Modified": "12 August 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has been known to create or enable accounts, such as support_388945a0.[1]"], "G0087": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087", "APT39", "APT39 has created accounts on multiple compromised hosts to perform actions within the network.[2]"], "G0096": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096", "APT41", "APT41 created user accounts and adds them to the User and Admin groups.[3]"], "S0274": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0274", "Calisto", "Calisto has the capability to add its own account to the victim's machine.[4]"], "S0030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0030", "Carbanak", "Carbanak can create a Windows account.[5]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has created accounts on victims, including administrator accounts, some of which appeared to be tailored to each individual staging target.[6]"], "S0363": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363", "Empire", "Empire has a module for creating a local user if permissions allow.[7]"], "S0143": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0143", "Flame", "Flame can create backdoor accounts with login \"HelpAssistant\" on domain connected systems if appropriate rights are available.[8][9]"], "G0117": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0117", "Fox Kitten", "Fox Kitten has created a local user account with administrator privileges.[10]"], "S0493": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0493", "GoldenSpy", "GoldenSpy can create new users on an infected system.[11]"], "S0394": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0394", "HiddenWasp", "HiddenWasp creates a user account as a means to provide initial persistence to the compromised machine.[12]"], "S0601": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0601", "Hildegard", "Hildegard has created a user named \"monerodaemon\".[13]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has created accounts with net user.[14]"], "G0077": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0077", "Leafminer", "Leafminer used a tool called Imecab to set up a persistent remote access account on the victim machine.[15]"], "S0084": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0084", "Mis-Type", "Mis-Type may create a temporary user on the system named \"Lost_{Unique Identifier}.\"[16]"], "S0039": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039", "Net", "The net user username \\password commands in Net can be used to create a local account.[17]"], "S0192": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0192", "Pupy", "Pupy can user PowerView to execute \"net user\" commands and create local system accounts.[18]"], "S0085": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0085", "S-Type", "S-Type may create a temporary user on the system named \"Lost_{Unique Identifier}\" with the password \"pond~!@6\"{Unique Identifier}.\"[16]"], "S0382": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0382", "ServHelper", "ServHelper has created a new user and added it to the \"Remote Desktop Users\" and \"Administrators\" groups.[19]"], "S0649": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0649", "SMOKEDHAM", "SMOKEDHAM has created user accounts and added them to local Admin groups.[20]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has created local privileged users on victim machines.[21]"], "S0412": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0412", "ZxShell", "ZxShell has a feature to create local user accounts.[22]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032", "Multi-factor Authentication", "Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts."], "M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Limit the usage of local administrator accounts to be used for day-to-day operations that may expose them to potential adversaries."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments for actions that are associated with local account creation, such as net user /add , useradd , and dscl -create", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Process Creation": ["Monitor newly executed processes associated with account creation, such as net.exe", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"], "User Account Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed user accounts through account audits to detect suspicious accounts that may have been created by an adversary.
