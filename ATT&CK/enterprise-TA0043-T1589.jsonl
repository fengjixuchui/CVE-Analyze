Information about identities may include a variety of details, including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, etc.) as well as sensitive details such as credentials.Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Information about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e. Active Scanning) such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system.[1] Information about victims may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites).[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing or Valid Accounts).", "Property": {"ID": "T1589", "Sub-techniques": "T1589.001, T1589.002, T1589.003", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "21 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers.[10]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has acquired mobile phone numbers of potential targets, possibly for mobile malware or additional phishing operations.[11]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
