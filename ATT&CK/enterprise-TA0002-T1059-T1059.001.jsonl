PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system.[1] Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk.A number of PowerShell-based offensive testing tools are available, including Empire, PowerSploit, PoshC2, and PSAttack.[2]PowerShell commands/scripts can also be executed without directly invoking the powershell.exe binary through interfaces to PowerShell's underlying System.Management.Automation assembly DLL exposed through the .NET framework and Windows Common Language Interface (CLI).[3][4][5]", "Property": {"ID": "T1059.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1059", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platforms": "Windows", "Supports Remote": "Yes", "Contributors": "Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; Praetorian", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "09 March 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals is written and executed via PowerShell.[6]"], "S0622": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0622", "AppleSeed", "AppleSeed has the ability to execute its payload via PowerShell.[7]"], "G0073": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073", "APT19", "APT19 used PowerShell commands to execute payloads.[8]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 downloads and executes PowerShell scripts and performs PowerShell commands.[9][10][11]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has used encoded PowerShell scripts uploaded to CozyCar installations to download and install SeaDuke.
