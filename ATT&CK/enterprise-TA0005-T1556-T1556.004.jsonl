The modification includes a specific password which is implanted in the operating system image via the patch. Upon authentication attempts, the inserted code will first check to see if the user input is the password. If so, access is granted. Otherwise, the implanted code will pass the credentials on for verification of potentially valid credentials.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1556.004", "Sub-technique of": "T1556", "Tactics": "Credential Access, Defense Evasion, Persistence", "Platforms": "Network", "Permissions Required": "Administrator", "Version": "2.0", "Created": "19 October 2020", "Last Modified": "14 December 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0519": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0519", "SYNful Knock", "SYNful Knock has the capability to add its own custom backdoor password when it modifies the operating system of the affected network device.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032", "Multi-factor Authentication", "Use multi-factor authentication for user and privileged accounts.
