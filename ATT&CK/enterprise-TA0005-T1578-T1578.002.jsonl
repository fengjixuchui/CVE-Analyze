Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account. An adversary may Create Snapshot of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect Data from Local System or for Remote Data Staging.[1]Creating a new instance may also allow an adversary to carry out malicious activity within an environment without affecting the execution of current running instances.", "Property": {"ID": "T1578.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1578", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "IaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "14 May 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Routinely check user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to create new instances."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit permissions for creating new instances in accordance with least privilege.
