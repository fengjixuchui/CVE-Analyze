{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1584-T1584.001", "TTP_name": "Domains", "Description": "Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.[1] Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.[2]Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources. In such cases, an adversary may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the benefit of the trust associated with that domain.[3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1584.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1584", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Jeremy Galloway", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0006": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0006", "APT1", "APT1 hijacked FQDNs associated with legitimate websites hosted by hop points.[4]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has compromised domains to use for C2.[5]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has compromised legitimate sites and used them to distribute malware.[6]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has compromised legitimate domains, including those hosted in the US and Italy, for C2.[7]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has used compromised domains to host links targeted to specific phishing victims.[8][9][10]"], "G0134": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0134", "Transparent Tribe", "Transparent Tribe has compromised domains for use in targeted malicious campaigns.[11]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Active DNS": ["Monitor for queried domain name system (DNS) registry data that may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting.
