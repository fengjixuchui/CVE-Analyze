{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1606", "TTP_name": "Forge Web Credentials", "Description": "Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources. This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie, Steal Application Access Token, and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users. The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys, or other cryptographic seed values.[1]Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources (ex: Use Alternate Authentication Material), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.[2][3][4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1606", "Sub-techniques": "T1606.001, T1606.002", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "17 December 2020", "Last Modified": "12 October 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Administrators should perform an audit of all access lists and the permissions they have been granted to access web applications and services.
