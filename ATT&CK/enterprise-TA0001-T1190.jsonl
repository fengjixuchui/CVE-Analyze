{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0001-T1190", "TTP_name": "Exploit Public-Facing Application", "Description": "Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.[1][2][3][4][5] Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include Exploitation for Defense Evasion.If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via Escape to Host, or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.[6][7]", "Property": {"ID": "T1190", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "Containers, IaaS, Linux, Network, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Praetorian; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "2.3", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has used a variety of public exploits, including CVE 2020-0688 and CVE 2020-17144, to gain execution on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange; they have also conducted SQL injection attacks against external websites.[8][9]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has exploited CVE-2019-19781 for Citrix, CVE-2019-11510 for Pulse Secure VPNs, CVE-2018-13379 for FortiGate VPNs, and CVE-2019-9670 in Zimbra software to gain access.
