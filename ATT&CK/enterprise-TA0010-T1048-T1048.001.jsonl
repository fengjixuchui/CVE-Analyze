{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0010-T1048-T1048.001", "TTP_name": "Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol", "Description": "Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.Symmetric encryption algorithms are those that use shared or the same keys/secrets on each end of the channel. This requires an exchange or pre-arranged agreement/possession of the value used to encrypt and decrypt data.Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged, but adversaries may opt to manually share keys and implement symmetric cryptographic algorithms (ex: RC4, AES) vice using mechanisms that are baked into a protocol. This may result in multiple layers of encryption (in protocols that are natively encrypted such as HTTPS) or encryption in protocols that not typically encrypted (such as HTTP or FTP).", "Property": {"ID": "T1048.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1048", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "15 March 2020", "Last Modified": "28 March 2020"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037", "Filter Network Traffic", "Enforce proxies and use dedicated servers for services such as DNS and only allow those systems to communicate over respective ports/protocols, instead of all systems within a network."], "M1031": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031", "Network Intrusion Prevention", "Network intrusion detection and prevention systems that use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary command and control infrastructure and malware can be used to mitigate activity at the network level."], "M1030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030", "Network Segmentation", "Follow best practices for network firewall configurations to allow only necessary ports and traffic to enter and exit the network.[1]"]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Access": ["Monitor for files viewed in isolation that may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "Network Connection Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.", "DS0029", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0029", "Network Traffic"], "Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
