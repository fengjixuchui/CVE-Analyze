Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing. [1] It may be possible to bypass those security mechanisms by renaming the utility prior to utilization (ex: rename rundll32.exe). [2] An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths.
