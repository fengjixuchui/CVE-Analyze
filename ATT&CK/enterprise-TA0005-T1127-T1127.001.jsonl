MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.[1]Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code. The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.[1][2] MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task. MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution.[3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1127.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1127", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Windows", "System Requirements": ".NET Framework version 4 or higher", "Contributors": "@ionstorm; Carrie Roberts, @OrOneEqualsOne", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "27 March 2020", "Last Modified": "15 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0363": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363", "Empire", "Empire can use built-in modules to abuse trusted utilities like MSBuild.exe.[4]"], "G0101": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0101", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein has used MSbuild to execute an actor-created file.[5]"], "S0013": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0013", "PlugX", "A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application control techniques.[6]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "MSBuild.exe may not be necessary within an environment and should be removed if not being used."], "M1038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038", "Execution Prevention", "Use application control configured to block execution of msbuild.exe if it is not required for a given system or network to prevent potential misuse by adversaries.
