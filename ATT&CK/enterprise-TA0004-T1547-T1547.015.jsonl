Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.[1] Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.[2] Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as AppleScript, whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call SMLoginItemSetEnabled.Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage launchd, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.[2][3] Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.[4] Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.Adversaries can utilize AppleScript and Native API calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.[5] Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using AppleScript to send an Apple events to the \"System Events\" process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.[6] Adversaries can use a command such as tell application \"System Events\" to make login item at end with properties /path/to/executable.[7][8][9] This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm.[7] Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.[10][11][12]", "Property": {"ID": "T1547.015", "Sub-technique of": "T1547", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "macOS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "05 October 2021", "Last Modified": "18 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0281": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0281", "Dok", "Dok uses AppleScript to install a login Item by sending Apple events to the System Events process.[8]"], "S0690": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0690", "Green Lambert", "Green Lambert can add Login Items to establish persistence.[13][14]"], "S0198": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0198", "NETWIRE", "NETWIRE can persist via startup options for Login items.[15]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"File Creation": ["All login items created via shared file lists are viewable by using the System Preferences GUI or in the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm file.[1][7][16][17] These locations should be monitored and audited.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "File Modification": ["All login items created via shared file lists are viewable by using the System Preferences GUI or in the ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm file.[1][7][16][17] These locations should be monitored and audited.", "", "", ""], "Process Creation": ["Monitor processes that start at login for unusual or unknown applications.
