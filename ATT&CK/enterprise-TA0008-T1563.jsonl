{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0008-T1563", "TTP_name": "Remote Service Session Hijacking", "Description": "Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems. Remote Service Session Hijacking differs from use of Remote Services because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using Valid Accounts.[1][2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1563", "Sub-techniques": "T1563.001, T1563.002", "Tactic": "Lateral Movement", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "SYSTEM, root", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "25 February 2020", "Last Modified": "23 March 2020"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Disable the remote service (ex: SSH, RDP, etc.) if it is unnecessary."], "M1030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030", "Network Segmentation", "Enable firewall rules to block unnecessary traffic between network security zones within a network."], "M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Do not allow remote access to services as a privileged account unless necessary."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit remote user permissions if remote access is necessary."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Logon Session Creation": ["Monitor for user accounts logged into systems they would not normally access or access patterns to multiple systems over a relatively short period of time.", "DS0028", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0028", "Logon Session"], "Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s), leveraging SSL/TLS inspection for encrypted traffic, that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
