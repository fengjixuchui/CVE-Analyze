In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.[1][2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1578.004", "Sub-technique of": "T1578", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "IaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Netskope", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "16 June 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Instance Metadata": ["Periodically baseline instances to identify malicious modifications or additions.", "DS0030", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0030", "Instance"], "Instance Modification": ["Establish centralized logging of instance activity, which can be used to monitor and review system events even after reverting to a snapshot, rolling back changes, or changing persistence/type of storage.
