Msiexec.exe is the command-line utility for the Windows Installer and is thus commonly associated with executing installation packages (.msi).[1] The Msiexec.exe binary may also be digitally signed by Microsoft.Adversaries may abuse msiexec.exe to launch local or network accessible MSI files. Msiexec.exe can also execute DLLs.[2][3] Since it may be signed and native on Windows systems, msiexec.exe can be used to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse. Msiexec.exe execution may also be elevated to SYSTEM privileges if the AlwaysInstallElevated policy is enabled.[4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1218.007", "Sub-technique of": "T1218", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Windows", "Defense Bypassed": "Application control, Digital Certificate Validation", "Contributors": "Alexandros Pappas; Ziv Kaspersky, Cymptom", "Version": "2.0", "Created": "24 January 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0584": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0584", "AppleJeus", "AppleJeus has been installed via MSI installer.[5]"], "S0631": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0631", "Chaes", "Chaes has used .MSI files as an initial way to start the infection chain.[6]"], "S0611": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0611", "Clop", "Clop can use msiexec.exe to disable security tools on the system.[7]"], "S0038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0038", "Duqu", "Duqu has used msiexec to execute malicious Windows Installer packages.
