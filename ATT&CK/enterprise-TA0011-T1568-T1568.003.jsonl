A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.[1]One implementation of DNS Calculation is to take the first three octets of an IP address in a DNS response and use those values to calculate the port for command and control traffic.[1][2][3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1568.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1568", "Tactic": "Command and Control", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "11 March 2020", "Last Modified": "27 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"G0005": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0005", "APT12", "APT12 has used multiple variants of DNS Calculation including multiplying the first two octets of an IP address and adding the third octet to that value in order to get a resulting command and control port.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
