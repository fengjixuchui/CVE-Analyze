{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0003-T1543-T1543.003", "TTP_name": "Windows Service", "Description": "Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions.[1] Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.Adversaries may install a new service or modify an existing service to execute at startup in order to persist on a system. Service configurations can be set or modified using system utilities (such as sc.exe), by directly modifying the Registry, or by interacting directly with the Windows API.Adversaries may also use services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping a driver file (ex: .sys) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered via Native API functions such as CreateServiceW() (or manually via functions such as ZwLoadDriver() and ZwSetValueKey()), by creating the required service Registry values (i.e. Modify Registry), or by using command-line utilities such as PnPUtil.exe.[2][3][4] Adversaries may leverage these drivers as Rootkits to hide the presence of malicious activity on a system. Adversaries may also load a signed yet vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine (known as \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD)) as part of Exploitation for Privilege Escalation.[5][4]Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges. Adversaries may also directly start services through Service Execution. To make detection analysis more challenging, malicious services may also incorporate Masquerade Task or Service (ex: using a service and/or payload name related to a legitimate OS or benign software component).", "Property": {"ID": "T1543.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1543", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "Windows", "Effective Permissions": "Administrator, SYSTEM", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-478, CAPEC-550, CAPEC-551", "Contributors": "Akshat Pradhan, Qualys; Matthew Demaske, Adaptforward; Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; Pedro Harrison; Wietze Beukema, @wietze", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "17 January 2020", "Last Modified": "20 May 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0504": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0504", "Anchor", "Anchor can establish persistence by creating a service.[6]"], "S0584": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0584", "AppleJeus", "AppleJeus can install itself as a service.[7]"], "G0073": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073", "APT19", "An APT19 Port 22 malware variant registers itself as a service.[8]"], "G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has a tool that creates a new service for persistence.[9]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 modified Windows Services to ensure PowerShell scripts were loaded on the system.
