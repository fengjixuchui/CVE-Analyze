{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0008-T1563-T1563.002", "TTP_name": "RDP Hijacking", "Description": "Adversaries may hijack a legitimate userâ€™s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment. Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).[1]Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, c:\\windows\\system32\\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen], an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user.[2] This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.[3] It can also lead to Remote System Discovery and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools.[4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1563.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1563", "Tactic": "Lateral Movement", "Platforms": "Windows", "Permissions Required": "SYSTEM", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "25 February 2020", "Last Modified": "23 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"G0001": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001", "Axiom", "Axiom has targeted victims with remote administration tools including RDP.[5]"], "S0366": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0366", "WannaCry", "WannaCry enumerates current remote desktop sessions and tries to execute the malware on each session.[6]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Audit the Remote Desktop Users group membership regularly.
