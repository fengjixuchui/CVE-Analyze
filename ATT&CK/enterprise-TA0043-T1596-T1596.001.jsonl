{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0043-T1596-T1596.001", "TTP_name": "DNS/Passive DNS", "Description": "Adversaries may search DNS data for information about victims that can be used during targeting. DNS information may include a variety of details, including registered name servers as well as records that outline addressing for a targetâ€™s subdomains, mail servers, and other hosts.Adversaries may search DNS data to gather actionable information. Threat actors can query nameservers for a target organization directly, or search through centralized repositories of logged DNS query responses (known as passive DNS).[1][2] Adversaries may also seek and target DNS misconfigurations/leaks that reveal information about internal networks. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Victim-Owned Websites or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Acquire Infrastructure or Compromise Infrastructure), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Trusted Relationship).", "Property": {"ID": "T1596.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1596", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
