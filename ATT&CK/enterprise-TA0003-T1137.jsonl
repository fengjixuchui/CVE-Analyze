Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.[1] These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.[2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1137", "Sub-techniques": "T1137.001, T1137.002, T1137.003, T1137.004, T1137.005, T1137.006", "Tactic": "Persistence", "Platforms": "Office 365, Windows", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, User", "Contributors": "Loic Jaquemet; Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Nick Carr, Mandiant; Praetorian; Ricardo Dias; Sahar Shukrun", "Version": "1.3", "Created": "14 December 2017", "Last Modified": "15 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 have replaced Microsoft Outlook's VbaProject.OTM file to install a backdoor macro for persistence.[3][4]"], "G0047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047", "Gamaredon Group", "Gamaredon Group has inserted malicious macros into existing documents, providing persistence when they are reopened.
