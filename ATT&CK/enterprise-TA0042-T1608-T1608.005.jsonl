{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1608-T1608.005", "TTP_name": "Link Target", "Description": "Adversaries may put in place resources that are referenced by a link that can be used during targeting. An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials) or to gain execution, as in Malicious Link. Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser. Prior to a phish for information (as in Spearphishing Link) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as in Spearphishing Link), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link.Typically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page that may include some client-side script such as JavaScript to decide what content to serve to the user. Adversaries may clone legitimate sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest credentials during Spearphishing Link.[1][2] Adversaries may also Upload Malware and have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure (Domains) to help facilitate Malicious Link. Link shortening services can also be employed.", "Property": {"ID": "T1608.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1608", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "17 March 2021", "Last Modified": "17 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0122": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0122", "Silent Librarian", "Silent Librarian has cloned victim organization login pages and staged them for later use in credential harvesting campaigns.
