For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.[1]Depending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API. This allows the adversary to gain information without making any API requests.", "Property": {"ID": "T1538", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Praetorian", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "30 August 2019", "Last Modified": "16 March 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Enforce the principle of least-privilege by limiting dashboard visibility to only the resources required.
