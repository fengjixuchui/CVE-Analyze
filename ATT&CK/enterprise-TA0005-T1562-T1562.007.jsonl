Cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in Disable or Modify System Firewall.Cloud environments typically utilize restrictive security groups and firewall rules that only allow network activity from trusted IP addresses via expected ports and protocols. An adversary may introduce new firewall rules or policies to allow access into a victim cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use a script or utility that creates new ingress rules in existing security groups to allow any TCP/IP connectivity.[1]Modifying or disabling a cloud firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed.", "Property": {"ID": "T1562.007", "Sub-technique of": "T1562", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "IaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Expel", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "24 June 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Routinely check account role permissions to ensure only expected users and roles have permission to modify cloud firewalls."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Ensure least privilege principles are applied to Identity and Access Management (IAM) security policies.[1]"]}, "Detection": {"Firewall Disable": ["Monitor for changes in the status of the system firewall such as Windows Security Auditing events 5025 (The Windows firewall service has been stopped) and 5034 (The Windows firewall driver was stopped).", "DS0018", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0018", "Firewall"], "Firewall Rule Modification": ["Monitor cloud logs for modification or creation of new security groups or firewall rules.", "", "", ""]}}
