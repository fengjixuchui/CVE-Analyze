{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0001-T1199", "TTP_name": "Trusted Relationship", "Description": "Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, Valid Accounts used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1199", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "IaaS, Linux, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Praetorian", "Version": "2.2", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "08 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "Once APT28 gained access to the DCCC network, the group then proceeded to use that access to compromise the DNC network.[2]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has gained access through compromised accounts at cloud solution partners, and used compromised certificates issued by Mimecast to authenticate to Mimecast customer systems.[3][4][5]"], "G0115": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0115", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD has breached Managed Service Providers (MSP's) to deliver malware to MSP customers.[6]"], "G0045": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045", "menuPass", "menuPass has used legitimate access granted to Managed Service Providers in order to access victims of interest.[7][8][9][10][11]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has used dedicated network connections from one victim organization to gain unauthorized access to a separate organization.[12]"], "G0027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027", "Threat Group-3390", "Threat Group-3390 has compromised third party service providers to gain access to victim's environments.[13]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030", "Network Segmentation", "Network segmentation can be used to isolate infrastructure components that do not require broad network access."], "M1052": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1052", "User Account Control", "Properly manage accounts and permissions used by parties in trusted relationships to minimize potential abuse by the party and if the party is compromised by an adversary."]}, "Detection": {"Application Log Content": ["Configuration management databases (CMDB) and other asset management systems may help with the detection of computer systems or network devices that should not exist on a network.", "DS0015", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0015", "Application Log"], "Logon Session Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior that may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.", "DS0028", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0028", "Logon Session"], "Logon Session Metadata": ["Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).", "", "", ""]}}
