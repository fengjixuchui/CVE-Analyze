Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.[1]Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.", "Property": {"ID": "T1195.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1195", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "11 March 2020", "Last Modified": "28 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0658": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0658", "XCSSET", "XCSSET adds malicious code to a host's Xcode projects by enumerating CocoaPods target_integrator.rb files under the /Library/Ruby/Gems folder or enumerates all .xcodeproj folders under a given directory.
