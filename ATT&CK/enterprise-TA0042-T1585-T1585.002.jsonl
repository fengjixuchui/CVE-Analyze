Adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct Phishing for Information or Phishing.[1] Adversaries may also take steps to cultivate a persona around the email account, such as through use of Social Media Accounts, to increase the chance of success of follow-on behaviors. Created email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: Domains).[1]To decrease the chance of physically tying back operations to themselves, adversaries may make use of disposable email services.[2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1585.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1585", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0006": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0006", "APT1", "APT1 has created email accounts for later use in social engineering, phishing, and when registering domains.[1]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has created email accounts for phishing operations.[3]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has created new email accounts for spearphishing operations.[4][5]"], "G0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065", "Leviathan", "Leviathan has created new email accounts for targeting efforts.[6]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has established email accounts using fake personas for spearphishing operations.[7][8]"], "G0129": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129", "Mustang Panda", "Mustang Panda has leveraged the legitimate email marketing service SMTP2Go for phishing campaigns.[9]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has created email accounts that mimic legitimate organizations for its spearphishing operations.[10]"], "G0122": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0122", "Silent Librarian", "Silent Librarian has established e-mail accounts to receive e-mails forwarded from compromised accounts.[11]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {}}
