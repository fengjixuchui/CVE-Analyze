Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1537", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "IaaS", "Contributors": "Darin Smith, Cisco; Praetorian", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "30 August 2019", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037", "Filter Network Traffic", "Implement network-based filtering restrictions to prohibit data transfers to untrusted VPCs."], "M1027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027", "Password Policies", "Consider rotating access keys within a certain number of days to reduce the effectiveness of stolen credentials."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit user account and IAM policies to the least privileges required.
