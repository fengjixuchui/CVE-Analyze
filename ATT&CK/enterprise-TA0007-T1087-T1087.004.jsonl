Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application.With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find accounts. The Get-MsolRoleMember PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions group in Office 365.[1][2] The Azure CLI (AZ CLI) also provides an interface to obtain user accounts with authenticated access to a domain. The command az ad user list will list all users within a domain.[3][4]The AWS command aws iam list-users may be used to obtain a list of users in the current account while aws iam list-roles can obtain IAM roles that have a specified path prefix.[5][6] In GCP, gcloud iam service-accounts list and gcloud projects get-iam-policy may be used to obtain a listing of service accounts and users in a project.[7]", "Property": {"ID": "T1087.004", "Sub-technique of": "T1087", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Praetorian", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "21 February 2020", "Last Modified": "16 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals can enumerate Azure AD users.[8]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has conducted enumeration of Azure AD accounts.[9]"], "S0684": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0684", "ROADTools", "ROADTools can enumerate Azure AD users.[10]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Routinely check user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the ability to list IAM identities or otherwise discover cloud accounts."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit permissions to discover cloud accounts in accordance with least privilege.
