Account credentials gathered by adversaries may be those directly associated with the target victim organization or attempt to take advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.Adversaries may gather credentials from potential victims in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information. Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect website authentication cookies from visitors.[1] Credential information may also be exposed to adversaries via leaks to online or other accessible data sets (ex: Search Engines, breach dumps, code repositories, etc.).[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] Adversaries may also purchase credentials from dark web or other black-markets. Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Compromise Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Valid Accounts).", "Property": {"ID": "T1589.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1589", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Lee Christensen, SpecterOps; Toby Kohlenberg; Vinayak Wadhwa, Lucideus", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has harvested user's login credentials.[9]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has conducted credential theft operations to obtain credentials to be used for access to victim environments.[10]"], "G0114": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0114", "Chimera", "Chimera has collected credentials for the target organization from previous breaches for use in brute force attacks.[11]"], "G0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065", "Leviathan", "Leviathan has collected compromised credentials to use for targeting efforts.[12]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound gathered credentials from two victims that they then attempted to validate across 75 different websites.[13]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
