A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.Permissions gained from the modification of infrastructure components may bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing infrastructure. Modifying infrastructure components may also allow an adversary to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1578", "Sub-techniques": "T1578.001, T1578.002, T1578.003, T1578.004", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "IaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "30 August 2019", "Last Modified": "20 April 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Routinely monitor user permissions to ensure only the expected users have the capability to modify cloud compute infrastructure components."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit permissions for creating, deleting, and otherwise altering compute components in accordance with least privilege.
