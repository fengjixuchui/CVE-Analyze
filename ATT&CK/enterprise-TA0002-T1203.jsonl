{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0002-T1203", "TTP_name": "Exploitation for Client Execution", "Description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.Several types exist:Web browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise and Spearphishing Link. Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing. Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.", "Property": {"ID": "T1203", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "System Requirements": "Remote exploitation for execution requires a remotely accessible service reachable over the network or other vector of access such as spearphishing or drive-by compromise.", "Version": "1.4", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "18 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0018", "admin@338", "admin@338 has exploited client software vulnerabilities for execution, such as Microsoft Word CVE-2012-0158.[1]"], "S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla has exploited Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2017-8570 for execution during delivery.[2]"], "G0138": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0138", "Andariel", "Andariel has exploited numerous ActiveX vulnerabilities, including zero-days.[3][4][5]"], "G0005": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0005", "APT12", "APT12 has exploited multiple vulnerabilities for execution, including Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2009-3129, CVE-2012-0158) and vulnerabilities in Adobe Reader and Flash (CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-0927, CVE-2011-0609, CVE-2011-0611).[6][7]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has exploited Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0262 for execution.[8]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has used multiple software exploits for common client software, like Microsoft Word, Exchange, and Adobe Reader, to gain code execution.[9][10][11]"], "G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has exploited the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability CVE-2015-3113 and Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2014-1776.[12][13]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has used RTF document that includes an exploit to execute malicious code.
