If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection, modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel.Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access or proximity, and the connection might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.", "Property": {"ID": "T1011", "Sub-techniques": "T1011.001", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Itzik Kotler, SafeBreach", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1028": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1028", "Operating System Configuration", "Prevent the creation of new network adapters where possible.[1][2]"]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Access": ["Monitor for files being accessed that could be related to exfiltration, such as file reads by a process that also has an active network connection.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "Network Connection Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed network connections that may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel.
