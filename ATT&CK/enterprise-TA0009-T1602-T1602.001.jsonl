{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0009-T1602-T1602.001", "TTP_name": "SNMP (MIB Dump)", "Description": "Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).The MIB is a configuration repository that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables. SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages[1]. The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details.Adversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information that allows the adversary to build network maps and facilitate future targeted exploitation.[2][3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1602.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1602", "Tactic": "Collection", "Platforms": "Network", "Permissions Required": "Administrator", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "19 October 2020", "Last Modified": "22 October 2020"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1041": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041", "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Configure SNMPv3 to use the highest level of security (authPriv) available.[4]"], "M1037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037", "Filter Network Traffic", "Apply extended ACLs to block unauthorized protocols outside the trusted network.[4]"], "M1031": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031", "Network Intrusion Prevention", "Configure intrusion prevention devices to detect SNMP queries and commands from unauthorized sources.[2]"], "M1030": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1030", "Network Segmentation", "Segregate SNMP traffic on a separate management network.[4]"], "M1054": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054", "Software Configuration", "Allowlist MIB objects and implement SNMP views.[5]"], "M1051": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051", "Update Software", "Keep system images and software updated and migrate to SNMPv3.[3]"]}, "Detection": {"Network Connection Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts or uncommon data flows.
