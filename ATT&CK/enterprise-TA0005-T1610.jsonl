{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0005-T1610", "TTP_name": "Deploy Container", "Description": "Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment.Containers can be deployed by various means, such as via Docker's create and start APIs or via a web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard or Kubeflow.[1][2][3] Adversaries may deploy containers based on retrieved or built malicious images or from benign images that download and execute malicious payloads at runtime.[4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1610", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactics": "Defense Evasion, Execution", "Platforms": "Containers", "Permissions Required": "User, root", "Supports Remote": "Yes", "Contributors": "Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; Ariel Shuper, Cisco; Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID); Idan Frimark, Cisco; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Pawan Kinger, @kingerpawan, Trend Micro; Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "29 March 2021", "Last Modified": "01 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0600": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0600", "Doki", "Doki was run through a deployed container.[5]"], "S0599": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0599", "Kinsing", "Kinsing was run through a deployed Ubuntu container.[6]"], "S0683": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0683", "Peirates", "Peirates can deploy a pod that mounts its nodeâ€™s root file system, then execute a command to create a reverse shell on the node.[7]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has deployed different types of containers into victim environments to facilitate execution.[8][9]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Scan images before deployment, and block those that are not in compliance with security policies.
