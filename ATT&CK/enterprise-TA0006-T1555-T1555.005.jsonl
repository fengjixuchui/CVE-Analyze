{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1555-T1555.005", "TTP_name": "Password Managers", "Description": "Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.[1] Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.[1]Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.[2][3] Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access.[4] Adversaries may also try brute forcing via Password Guessing to obtain the master password of a password manager.[5]", "Property": {"ID": "T1555.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1555", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Matt Burrough, @mattburrough, Microsoft", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "22 January 2021", "Last Modified": "25 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0117": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0117", "Fox Kitten", "Fox Kitten has used scripts to access credential information from the KeePass database.[6]"], "S0652": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0652", "MarkiRAT", "MarkiRAT can gather information from the Keepass password manager.[7]"], "G0116": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0116", "Operation Wocao", "Operation Wocao has accessed and collected credentials from password managers.[2]"], "S0279": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0279", "Proton", "Proton gathers credentials in files for 1password.[8]"], "G0027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027", "Threat Group-3390", "Threat Group-3390 obtained a KeePass database from a compromised host.[9]"], "S0266": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0266", "TrickBot", "TrickBot can steal passwords from the KeePass open source password manager.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027", "Password Policies", "Refer to NIST guidelines when creating password policies for master passwords.[10]"], "M1054": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054", "Software Configuration", "Consider re-locking password managers after a short timeout to limit the time plaintext credentials live in memory from decrypted databases."], "M1051": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051", "Update Software", "Update password managers regularly by employing patch management for internal enterprise endpoints and servers."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.
