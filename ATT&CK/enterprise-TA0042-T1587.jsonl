{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1587", "TTP_name": "Develop Capabilities", "Description": "Adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house. This is the process of identifying development requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.[1][2][3][4]As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing capabilities. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the capability.", "Property": {"ID": "T1587", "Sub-techniques": "T1587.001, T1587.002, T1587.003, T1587.004", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "17 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky created and used a mailing toolkit to use in spearphishing attacks.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Response Content": ["Consider use of services that may aid in the tracking of capabilities, such as certificates, in use on sites across the Internet.
