{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0043-T1598", "TTP_name": "Phishing for Information", "Description": "Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Phishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Phishing for information is different from Phishing in that the objective is gathering data from the victim rather than executing malicious code.All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass credential harvesting campaigns.Adversaries may also try to obtain information directly through the exchange of emails, instant messages, or other electronic conversation means.[1][2][3][4][5] Phishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: Establish Accounts or Compromise Accounts) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.", "Property": {"ID": "T1598", "Sub-techniques": "T1598.001, T1598.002, T1598.003", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Philip Winther; Robert Simmons, @MalwareUtkonos; Sebastian Salla, McAfee", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has used spearphishing to compromise credentials.[6][7]"], "G0128": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0128", "ZIRCONIUM", "ZIRCONIUM targeted presidential campaign staffers with credential phishing e-mails.[8]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1054": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054", "Software Configuration", "Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM).
