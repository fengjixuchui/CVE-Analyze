There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party entities. By compromising a VPS to use as infrastructure, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to themselves.[1]Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party.", "Property": {"ID": "T1584.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1584", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "17 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0010": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010", "Turla", "Turla has used the VPS infrastructure of compromised Iranian threat actors.[1]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Response Content": ["Once adversaries have provisioned software on a compromised VPS (ex: for use as a command and control server), internet scans may reveal VPSs that adversaries have compromised.
