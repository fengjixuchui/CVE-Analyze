Adversaries can use compromised email accounts to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct Phishing for Information or Phishing. Utilizing an existing persona with a compromised email account may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona. Compromised email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: Domains).A variety of methods exist for compromising email accounts, such as gathering credentials via Phishing for Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps).[1] Prior to compromising email accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.Adversaries can use a compromised email account to hijack existing email threads with targets of interest.", "Property": {"ID": "T1586.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1586", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has used compromised email accounts to send credential phishing emails.[2]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has compromised email accounts to further enable phishing campaigns.[3]"], "G0136": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0136", "IndigoZebra", "IndigoZebra has compromised legitimate email accounts to use in their spearphishing operations.[4]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has compromised email accounts to send spearphishing e-mails.[5][6]"], "G0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065", "Leviathan", "Leviathan has compromised email accounts to conduct social engineering attacks.[7]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has compromised personal email accounts through the use of legitimate credentials and gathered additional victim information.[8]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {}}
