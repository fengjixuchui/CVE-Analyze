When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility.[1][2][3] Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.System file associations are listed under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.[extension], for example HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.txt. The entries point to a handler for that extension located at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\[handler]. The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\[handler]\\shell\\[action]\\command. For example:The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension. Adversaries can modify these values to continually execute arbitrary commands.[4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1546.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1546", "Tactics": "Privilege Escalation, Persistence", "Platforms": "Windows", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, SYSTEM, User", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-556", "Contributors": "Stefan Kanthak; Travis Smith, Tripwire", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "24 January 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has a HWP document stealer module which changes the default program association in the registry to open HWP documents.[5]"], "S0692": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0692", "SILENTTRINITY", "SILENTTRINITY can conduct an image hijack of an .msc file extension as part of its UAC bypass process.[6]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Process Creation": ["Monitor for newly executed processes that may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association.", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"], "Windows Registry Key Modification": ["Collect and analyze changes to Registry keys that associate file extensions to default applications for execution and correlate with unknown process launch activity or unusual file types for that process.
