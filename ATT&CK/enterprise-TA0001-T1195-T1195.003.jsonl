{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0001-T1195-T1195.003", "TTP_name": "Compromise Hardware Supply Chain", "Description": "Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.", "Property": {"ID": "T1195.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1195", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "11 March 2020", "Last Modified": "28 April 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1046": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1046", "Boot Integrity", "Use Trusted Platform Module technology and a secure or trusted boot process to prevent system integrity from being compromised.
