Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as Archive Collected Data. Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within cmd and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary may Create Cloud Instance and stage data in that instance.[1]By staging data on one system prior to Exfiltration, adversaries can minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.", "Property": {"ID": "T1074.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1074", "Tactic": "Collection", "Platforms": "IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Praetorian", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "13 March 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has staged archives of collected data on a target's Outlook Web Access (OWA) server.[2]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 staged data and files in password-protected archives on a victim's OWA server.[3]"], "G0114": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0114", "Chimera", "Chimera has staged stolen data on designated servers in the target environment.[4]"], "G0037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037", "FIN6", "FIN6 actors have compressed data from remote systems and moved it to another staging system before exfiltration.[5]"], "G0061": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0061", "FIN8", "FIN8 aggregates staged data from a network into a single location.[6]"], "G0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065", "Leviathan", "Leviathan has staged data remotely prior to exfiltration.[7]"], "G0045": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0045", "menuPass", "menuPass has staged data on remote MSP systems or other victim networks prior to exfiltration.[8][9]"], "G0014": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0014", "Night Dragon", "Night Dragon has copied files to company web servers and subsequently downloaded them.[10]"], "G0027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0027", "Threat Group-3390", "Threat Group-3390 has moved staged encrypted archives to Internet-facing servers that had previously been compromised with China Chopper prior to exfiltration.[11]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments arguments for actions that could be taken to collect and combine files.
