Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.[1]Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource (e.g. MSSQL) and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center (KDC), potentially making detection more difficult.[2]Password hashes for target services may be obtained using OS Credential Dumping or Kerberoasting.", "Property": {"ID": "T1558.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1558", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Windows", "Permissions Required": "User", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "11 February 2020", "Last Modified": "25 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using the password hash of the AZUREADSSOACC account.[3]"], "S0363": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0363", "Empire", "Empire can leverage its implementation of Mimikatz to obtain and use silver tickets.[4]"], "S0002": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0002", "Mimikatz", "Mimikatz's kerberos module can create silver tickets.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1041": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041", "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Enable AES Kerberos encryption (or another stronger encryption algorithm), rather than RC4, where possible.[6]"], "M1027": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1027", "Password Policies", "Ensure strong password length (ideally 25+ characters) and complexity for service accounts and that these passwords periodically expire.[6] Also consider using Group Managed Service Accounts or another third party product such as password vaulting.[6]"], "M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Limit service accounts to minimal required privileges, including membership in privileged groups such as Domain Administrators.[6]"]}, "Detection": {"Logon Session Metadata": ["Monitor for anomalous Kerberos activity, such as malformed or blank fields in Windows logon/logoff events (Event ID 4624, 4634, 4672).", "DS0028", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0028", "Logon Session"]}}
