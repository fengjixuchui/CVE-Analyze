{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0010-T1567", "TTP_name": "Exfiltration Over Web Service", "Description": "Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.Web service providers also commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.", "Property": {"ID": "T1567", "Sub-techniques": "T1567.001, T1567.002", "Tactic": "Exfiltration", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "William Cain", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "09 March 2020", "Last Modified": "15 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0622": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0622", "AppleSeed", "AppleSeed has exfiltrated files using web services.[1]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 can exfiltrate data over Google Drive.[2]"], "S0547": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0547", "DropBook", "DropBook has used legitimate web services to exfiltrate data.[3]"], "S0508": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0508", "Ngrok", "Ngrok has been used by threat actors to configure servers for data exfiltration.[4]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1057": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1057", "Data Loss Prevention", "Data loss prevention can be detect and block sensitive data being uploaded to web services via web browsers."], "M1021": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1021", "Restrict Web-Based Content", "Web proxies can be used to enforce an external network communication policy that prevents use of unauthorized external services."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Access": ["Monitor for files being accessed by an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "Network Traffic Content": ["Monitor and analyze traffic patterns and packet inspection associated to protocol(s) that do not follow the expected protocol standards and traffic flows (e.g extraneous packets that do not belong to established flows, gratuitous or anomalous traffic patterns, anomalous syntax, or structure).
