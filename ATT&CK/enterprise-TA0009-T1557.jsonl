{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0009-T1557", "TTP_name": "Adversary-in-the-Middle", "Description": "Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation. By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.[1]For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.[2][3][4] Downgrade Attacks can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.[5][6][7]Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation. Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to Impair Defenses and/or in support of a Network Denial of Service.", "Property": {"ID": "T1557", "Sub-techniques": "T1557.001, T1557.002, T1557.003", "Tactics": "Credential Access, Collection", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-94", "Contributors": "Daniil Yugoslavskiy, @yugoslavskiy, Atomic Threat Coverage project; Mayuresh Dani, Qualys; NEC", "Version": "2.1", "Created": "11 February 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0281": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0281", "Dok", "Dok proxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP(S) traffic.[8][9]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.[10]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Disable legacy network protocols that may be used to intercept network traffic if applicable, especially those that are not needed within an environment."], "M1041": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1041", "Encrypt Sensitive Information", "Ensure that all wired and/or wireless traffic is encrypted appropriately.
