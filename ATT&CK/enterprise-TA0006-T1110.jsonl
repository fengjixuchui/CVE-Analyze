{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1110", "TTP_name": "Brute Force", "Description": "Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach. For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to Valid Accounts within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as OS Credential Dumping, Account Discovery, or Password Policy Discovery. Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as External Remote Services as part of Initial Access.", "Property": {"ID": "T1110", "Sub-techniques": "T1110.001, T1110.002, T1110.003, T1110.004", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Containers, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Network, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-49", "Contributors": "Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; David Fiser, @anu4is, Trend Micro; Ed Williams, Trustwave, SpiderLabs; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Mohamed Kmal; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "2.4", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 can perform brute force attacks to obtain credentials.[1][2][3]"], "G0082": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "APT38", "APT38 has used brute force techniques to attempt account access when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are unavailable.[4]"], "G0087": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0087", "APT39", "APT39 has used Ncrack to reveal credentials.[5]"], "S0572": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0572", "Caterpillar WebShell", "Caterpillar WebShell has a module to perform brute force attacks on a system.[6]"], "S0220": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0220", "Chaos", "Chaos conducts brute force attacks against SSH services to gain initial access.[7]"], "S0488": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0488", "CrackMapExec", "CrackMapExec can brute force supplied user credentials across a network range.[8]"], "G0105": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0105", "DarkVishnya", "DarkVishnya used brute-force attack to obtain login data.[9]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has attempted to brute force credentials to gain access.[10]"], "G0053": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0053", "FIN5", "FIN5 has has used the tool GET2 Penetrator to look for remote login and hard-coded credentials.[11][12]"], "G0117": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0117", "Fox Kitten", "Fox Kitten has brute forced RDP credentials.[13]"], "S0599": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0599", "Kinsing", "Kinsing has attempted to brute force hosts over SSH.[14]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has performed brute force attacks against administrator accounts.[15]"], "G0049": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0049", "OilRig", "OilRig has used brute force techniques to obtain credentials.[16]"], "S0378": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0378", "PoshC2", "PoshC2 has modules for brute forcing local administrator and AD user accounts.[17]"], "S0583": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0583", "Pysa", "Pysa has used brute force attempts against a central management console, as well as some Active Directory accounts.[18]"], "S0650": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0650", "QakBot", "QakBot can conduct brute force attacks to capture credentials.[19][20][21]"], "G0010": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010", "Turla", "Turla may attempt to connect to systems within a victim's network using net use commands and a predefined list or collection of passwords.[22]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1036": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1036", "Account Use Policies", "Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed.
