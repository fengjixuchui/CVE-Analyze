{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0008-T1550-T1550.004", "TTP_name": "Web Session Cookie", "Description": "Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.[1]Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. After the cookie is obtained through Steal Web Session Cookie or Web Cookies, the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active. Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.[2]", "Property": {"ID": "T1550.004", "Sub-technique of": "T1550", "Tactics": "Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement", "Platforms": "Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaS", "Defense Bypassed": "System Access Controls", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-60", "Contributors": "Jen Burns, HubSpot; Johann Rehberger", "Version": "1.3", "Created": "30 January 2020", "Last Modified": "12 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 used stolen cookies to access cloud resources, and a forged duo-sid cookie to bypass MFA set on an email account.[3][4]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1054": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054", "Software Configuration", "Configure browsers or tasks to regularly delete persistent cookies."]}, "Detection": {"Application Log Content": ["Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other service artifacts that provide context of user authentication to web applications, including cloud-based services.
