{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0007-T1082", "TTP_name": "System Information Discovery", "Description": "An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from System Information Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.Tools such as Systeminfo can be used to gather detailed system information. If running with privileged access, a breakdown of system data can be gathered through the systemsetup configuration tool on macOS. As an example, adversaries with user-level access can execute the df -aH command to obtain currently mounted disks and associated freely available space. Adversaries may also leverage a Network Device CLI on network devices to gather detailed system information.[1] System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment.[2][3]Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure allow access to instance and virtual machine information via APIs. Successful authenticated API calls can return data such as the operating system platform and status of a particular instance or the model view of a virtual machine.[4][5][6]", "Property": {"ID": "T1082", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "IaaS, Linux, Network, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-312", "Contributors": "Austin Clark, @c2defense; Maril Vernon @shewhohacks; Praetorian", "Version": "2.4", "Created": "31 May 2017", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0065", "4H RAT", "4H RAT sends an OS version identifier in its beacons.[7]"], "G0018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0018", "admin@338", "admin@338 actors used the following commands after exploiting a machine with LOWBALL malware to obtain information about the OS: ver >> %temp%\\download systeminfo >> %temp%\\download[8]"], "S0045": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0045", "ADVSTORESHELL", "ADVSTORESHELL can run Systeminfo to gather information about the victim.[9][10]"], "S0331": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0331", "Agent Tesla", "Agent Tesla can collect the system's computer name and also has the capability to collect information on the processor, memory, OS, and video card from the system.[11][12][13]"], "S0504": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0504", "Anchor", "Anchor can determine the hostname and linux version on a compromised host.[14]"], "S0584": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0584", "AppleJeus", "AppleJeus has collected the victim host information after infection.[15]"], "S0622": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0622", "AppleSeed", "AppleSeed can identify the OS version of a targeted system.[16]"], "G0026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0026", "APT18", "APT18 can collect system information from the victim’s machine.[17]"], "G0073": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0073", "APT19", "APT19 collected system architecture information.
