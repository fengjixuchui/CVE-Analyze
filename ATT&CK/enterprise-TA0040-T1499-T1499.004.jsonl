[1] Some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition.Adversaries may exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities to crash applications and/or systems, which may also lead to dependent applications and/or systems to be in a DoS condition. Crashed or restarted applications or systems may also have other effects such as Data Destruction, Firmware Corruption, Service Stop etc. which may further cause a DoS condition and deny availability to critical information, applications and/or systems.", "Property": {"ID": "T1499.004", "Sub-technique of": "T1499", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "Impact Type": "Availability", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "20 February 2020", "Last Modified": "25 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0604": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0604", "Industroyer", "Industroyer uses a custom DoS tool that leverages CVE-2015-5374 and targets hardcoded IP addresses of Siemens SIPROTEC devices.[2]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037", "Filter Network Traffic", "Leverage services provided by Content Delivery Networks (CDN) or providers specializing in DoS mitigations to filter traffic upstream from services.[3] Filter boundary traffic by blocking source addresses sourcing the attack, blocking ports that are being targeted, or blocking protocols being used for transport."]}, "Detection": {"Application Log Content": ["Monitor for third-party application logging, messaging, and/or other artifacts that may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.
