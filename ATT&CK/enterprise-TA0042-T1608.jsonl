To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed (Develop Capabilities) or obtained (Obtain Capabilities) and stage them on infrastructure under their control. These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary (Acquire Infrastructure) or was otherwise compromised by them (Compromise Infrastructure). Capabilities can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin.[1]Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including (but not limited to):", "Property": {"ID": "T1608", "Sub-techniques": "T1608.001, T1608.002, T1608.003, T1608.004, T1608.005", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "17 March 2021", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0129": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0129", "Mustang Panda", "Mustang Panda has used servers under their control to validate tracking pixels sent to phishing victims.[8]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Response Content": ["If infrastructure or patterns in malware, tooling, certificates, or malicious web content have been previously identified, internet scanning may uncover when an adversary has staged their capabilities.Much of this activity will take place outside the visibility of the target organization, making detection of this behavior difficult.
