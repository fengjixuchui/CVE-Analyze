{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0004-T1053-T1053.007", "TTP_name": "Container Orchestration Job", "Description": "Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks.[1][2] An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.[3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1053.007", "Sub-technique of": "T1053", "Tactics": "Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "Containers", "Permissions Required": "User", "Supports Remote": "Yes", "Contributors": "Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID); Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "29 March 2021", "Last Modified": "01 April 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Ensure containers are not running as root by default.
