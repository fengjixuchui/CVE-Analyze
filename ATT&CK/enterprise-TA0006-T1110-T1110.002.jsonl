{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1110-T1110.002", "TTP_name": "Password Cracking", "Description": "Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. OS Credential Dumping can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when Pass the Hash is not an option. Further, adversaries may leverage Data from Configuration Repository in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.[1]Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.[2] The resulting plaintext password resulting from a successfully cracked hash may be used to log into systems, resources, and services in which the account has access.", "Property": {"ID": "T1110.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1110", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Linux, Network, Office 365, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-55", "Contributors": "Mohamed Kmal", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "11 February 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0022", "APT3", "APT3 has been known to brute force password hashes to be able to leverage plain text credentials.[3]"], "G0096": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096", "APT41", "APT41 performed password brute-force attacks on the local admin account.[4]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has dropped and executed tools used for password cracking, including Hydra and CrackMapExec.[5][6]"], "G0037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037", "FIN6", "FIN6 has extracted password hashes from ntds.dit to crack offline.[7]"], "S0056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0056", "Net Crawler", "Net Crawler uses a list of known credentials gathered through credential dumping to guess passwords to accounts as it spreads throughout a network.[8]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1032", "Multi-factor Authentication", "Use multi-factor authentication.
