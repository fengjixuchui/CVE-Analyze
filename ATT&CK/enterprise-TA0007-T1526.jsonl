{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0007-T1526", "TTP_name": "Cloud Service Discovery", "Description": "An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc.Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment. Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity.[1][2]Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services.[3][4]", "Property": {"ID": "T1526", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Praetorian; Suzy Schapperle - Microsoft Azure Red Team", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "30 August 2019", "Last Modified": "16 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals can enumerate information about a variety of cloud services, such as Office 365 and Sharepoint instances or OpenID Configurations.[5]"], "S0684": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0684", "ROADTools", "ROADTools can enumerate Azure AD applications and service principals.[6]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Cloud Service Enumeration": ["Cloud service discovery techniques will likely occur throughout an operation where an adversary is targeting cloud-based systems and services.
