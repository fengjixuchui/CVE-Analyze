Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar to System Firmware but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.Malicious component firmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks.", "Property": {"ID": "T1542.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1542", "Tactics": "Persistence, Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "System Requirements": "Ability to update component device firmware from the host operating system.", "Permissions Required": "SYSTEM", "Defense Bypassed": "Anti-virus, File monitoring, Host intrusion prevention systems", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "19 December 2019", "Last Modified": "01 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0687": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0687", "Cyclops Blink", "Cyclops Blink has maintained persistence by patching legitimate device firmware when it is downloaded, including that of WatchGuard devices.[1]"], "G0020": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0020", "Equation", "Equation is known to have the capability to overwrite the firmware on hard drives from some manufacturers.[2]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1051": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051", "Update Software", "Perform regular firmware updates to mitigate risks of exploitation and/or abuse."]}, "Detection": {"Driver Metadata": ["Monitor for unexpected disk partition table entries, or blocks of otherwise unusual memory that warrant deeper investigation", "DS0027", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0027", "Driver"], "Firmware Modification": ["Monitor for changes that may reveal indicators of malicious firmware such as strings.
