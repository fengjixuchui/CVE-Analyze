{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1584", "TTP_name": "Compromise Infrastructure", "Description": "Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.[1][2][3][4] Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.Use of compromised infrastructure allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction with Digital Certificates) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/or Phishing campaigns.[5]By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them. Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.[6]", "Property": {"ID": "T1584", "Sub-techniques": "T1584.001, T1584.002, T1584.003, T1584.004, T1584.005, T1584.006", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Jeremy Galloway", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "01 October 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls."]}, "Detection": {"Active DNS": ["Monitor for queried domain name system (DNS) registry data that may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting.
