Information about victims may be available for purchase from reputable private sources and databases, such as paid subscriptions to feeds of technical/threat intelligence data.[1] Adversaries may also purchase information from less-reputable sources such as dark web or cybercrime blackmarkets.[2]Adversaries may search in different closed databases depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Phishing for Information or Search Open Websites/Domains), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: External Remote Services or Valid Accounts).", "Property": {"ID": "T1597", "Sub-techniques": "T1597.001, T1597.002", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
