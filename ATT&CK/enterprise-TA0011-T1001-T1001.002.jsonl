Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems. This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems. In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control.", "Property": {"ID": "T1001.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1001", "Tactic": "Command and Control", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "15 March 2020", "Last Modified": "15 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has used steganography to hide C2 communications in images.[1]"], "G0001": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001", "Axiom", "Axiom has used steganography to hide its C2 communications.[2]"], "S0187": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0187", "Daserf", "Daserf can use steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim.[3]"], "S0038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0038", "Duqu", "When the Duqu command and control is operating over HTTP or HTTPS, Duqu uploads data to its controller by appending it to a blank JPG file.[4]"], "S0037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0037", "HAMMERTOSS", "HAMMERTOSS is controlled via commands that are appended to image files.[5]"], "S0395": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0395", "LightNeuron", "LightNeuron is controlled via commands that are embedded into PDFs and JPGs using steganographic methods.[6]"], "S0495": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0495", "RDAT", "RDAT can process steganographic images attached to email messages to send and receive C2 commands.
