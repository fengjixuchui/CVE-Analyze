{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0042-T1583-T1583.001", "TTP_name": "Domains", "Description": "Adversaries may purchase domains that can be used during targeting. Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses. They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.Adversaries can use purchased domains for a variety of purposes, including for Phishing, Drive-by Compromise, and Command and Control.[1] Adversaries may choose domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or use of a different top-level domain (TLD).[2][3] Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of payloads via Drive-by Compromise. Adversaries can also use internationalized domain names (IDNs) to create visually similar lookalike domains for use in operations.[4]Domain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain. Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain. Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain. Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.[5]", "Property": {"ID": "T1583.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1583", "Tactic": "Resource Development", "Platforms": "PRE", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-630", "Contributors": "Deloitte Threat Library Team; Vinayak Wadhwa, Lucideus; Wes Hurd", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "30 September 2020", "Last Modified": "16 October 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0006": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0006", "APT1", "APT1 has registered hundreds of domains for use in operations.[5]"], "G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 registered domains imitating NATO, OSCE security websites, Caucasus information resources, and other organizations.[2][6][7]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has acquired C2 domains, sometimes through resellers.[8][9][10]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has set up and operated websites to gather information and deliver malware.[11]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has registered domains for targeting intended victims.[12]"], "G0137": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0137", "Ferocious Kitten", "Ferocious Kitten has acquired domains imitating legitimate sites.[13]"], "G0046": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0046", "FIN7", "FIN7 has registered look-alike domains for use in phishing campaigns.[14]"], "G0047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047", "Gamaredon Group", "Gamaredon Group has registered multiple domains to facilitate payload staging and C2.[15][16]"], "G0136": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0136", "IndigoZebra", "IndigoZebra has established domains, some of which were designed to look like official government domains, for their operations.[17]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has registered domains to spoof targeted organizations and trusted third parties.[18][19][20][21][22][23]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group has acquired domains related to their campaigns to act as distribution points and C2 channels.[24][25][26]"], "G0140": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0140", "LazyScripter", "LazyScripter has used dynamic DNS providers to create legitimate-looking subdomains for C2.[27]"], "G0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0065", "Leviathan", "Leviathan has established domains that impersonate legitimate entities to use for targeting efforts.
