{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0007-T1613", "TTP_name": "Container and Resource Discovery", "Description": "Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment. Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster.These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.[1][2] In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing. The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution.", "Property": {"ID": "T1613", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Containers", "Permissions Required": "User", "Contributors": "Center for Threat-Informed Defense (CTID); Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "31 March 2021", "Last Modified": "12 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0601": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0601", "Hildegard", "Hildegard has used masscan to search for kubelets and the kubelet API for additional running containers.[3]"], "S0683": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0683", "Peirates", "Peirates can enumerate Kubernetes pods in a given namespace.[4]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has checked for running containers with docker ps and for specific container names with docker inspect.[5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035", "Limit Access to Resource Over Network", "Limit communications with the container service to local Unix sockets or remote access via SSH.
