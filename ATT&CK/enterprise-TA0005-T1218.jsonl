Binaries used in this technique are often Microsoft-signed files, indicating that they have been either downloaded from Microsoft or are already native in the operating system.[1] Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can typically execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files or commands.Similarly, on Linux systems adversaries may abuse trusted binaries such as split to proxy execution of malicious commands.[2][3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1218", "Sub-techniques": "T1218.001, T1218.002, T1218.003, T1218.004, T1218.005, T1218.007, T1218.008, T1218.009, T1218.010, T1218.011, T1218.012, T1218.013, T1218.014", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Defense Bypassed": "Anti-virus, Application control, Digital Certificate Validation", "Contributors": "Hans Christoffer Gaardl√∏s; Nishan Maharjan, @loki248; Praetorian; Wes Hurd", "Version": "3.0", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "18 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group lnk files used for persistence have abused the Windows Update Client (wuauclt.exe) to execute a malicious DLL.[4][5]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Many native binaries may not be necessary within a given environment."], "M1038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038", "Execution Prevention", "Consider using application control to prevent execution of binaries that are susceptible to abuse and not required for a given system or network."], "M1050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1050", "Exploit Protection", "Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) feature can be used to block methods of using using trusted binaries to bypass application control."], "M1026": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1026", "Privileged Account Management", "Restrict execution of particularly vulnerable binaries to privileged accounts or groups that need to use it to lessen the opportunities for malicious usage."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Creation": ["Monitor for file activity (creations, downloads, modifications, etc.), especially for file types that are not typical within an environment and may be indicative of adversary activity.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "Module Load": ["Monitor DLL/PE file events, specifically creation of these binary files as well as the loading of DLLs into processes.
