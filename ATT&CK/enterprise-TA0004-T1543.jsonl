{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0004-T1543", "TTP_name": "Create or Modify System Process", "Description": "Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services.[1] On macOS, launchd processes known as Launch Daemon and Launch Agent are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.[2]Adversaries may install new services, daemons, or agents that can be configured to execute at startup or a repeatable interval in order to establish persistence. Similarly, adversaries may modify existing services, daemons, or agents to achieve the same effect.Services, daemons, or agents may be created with administrator privileges but executed under root/SYSTEM privileges. Adversaries may leverage this functionality to create or modify system processes in order to escalate privileges.[3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1543", "Sub-techniques": "T1543.001, T1543.002, T1543.003, T1543.004", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "10 January 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0401": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0401", "Exaramel for Linux", "Exaramel for Linux has a hardcoded location that it uses to achieve persistence if the startup system is Upstart or System V and it is running as root.[4]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Use auditing tools capable of detecting privilege and service abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them."], "M1040": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1040", "Behavior Prevention on Endpoint", "On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent an application from writing a signed vulnerable driver to the system.[5] On Windows 10 and 11, enable Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist to assist in hardening against third party-developed drivers.[6]"], "M1045": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1045", "Code Signing", "Enforce registration and execution of only legitimately signed service drivers where possible."], "M1033": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1033", "Limit Software Installation", "Restrict software installation to trusted repositories only and be cautious of orphaned software packages."], "M1028": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1028", "Operating System Configuration", "Ensure that Driver Signature Enforcement is enabled to restrict unsigned drivers from being installed."], "M1022": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1022", "Restrict File and Directory Permissions", "Restrict read/write access to system-level process files to only select privileged users who have a legitimate need to manage system services."], "M1018": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1018", "User Account Management", "Limit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with system-level process changes and service configurations."]}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Command-line invocation of tools capable of modifying services may be unusual, depending on how systems are typically used in a particular environment.
