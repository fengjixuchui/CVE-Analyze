The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain.

The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.[1]Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence. By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers (e.g., Hijack Execution Flow), an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads.", "Property": {"ID": "T1547.008", "Sub-technique of": "T1547", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation", "Platforms": "Windows", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, SYSTEM", "Contributors": "Vincent Le Toux", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "24 January 2020", "Last Modified": "20 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0208": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0208", "Pasam", "Pasam establishes by infecting the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk.[2]"], "S0176": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0176", "Wingbird", "Wingbird drops a malicious file (sspisrv.dll) alongside a copy of lsass.exe, which is used to register a service that loads sspisrv.dll as a driver.
