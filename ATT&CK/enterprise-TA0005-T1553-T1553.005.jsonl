In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named Zone.Identifier with a specific value known as the MOTW.[1] Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file in not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.[2][3][4]Adversaries may abuse container files such as compressed/archive (.arj, .gzip) and/or disk image (.iso, .vhd) file formats to deliver malicious payloads that may not be tagged with MOTW. Container files downloaded from the Internet will be marked with MOTW but the files within may not inherit the MOTW after the container files are extracted and/or mounted. MOTW is a NTFS feature and many container files do not support NTFS alternative data streams. After a container file is extracted and/or mounted, the files contained within them may be treated as local files on disk and run without protections.[2][3]", "Property": {"ID": "T1553.005", "Sub-technique of": "T1553", "Tactic": "Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Windows", "Defense Bypassed": "Anti-virus, Application Control", "Contributors": "Christiaan Beek, @ChristiaanBeek", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "22 February 2021", "Last Modified": "05 May 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has embedded ISO images and VHDX files in HTML to evade Mark-of-the-Web.[5]"], "G0092": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0092", "TA505", "TA505 has used .iso files to deploy malicious .lnk files.[6]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1042": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1042", "Disable or Remove Feature or Program", "Consider disabling auto-mounting of disk image files (i.e., .iso, .img, .vhd, and .vhdx).
