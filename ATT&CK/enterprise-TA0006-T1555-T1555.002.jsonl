{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0006-T1555-T1555.002", "TTP_name": "Securityd Memory", "Description": "An adversary may obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain. This provides the adversary with all the plaintext passwords for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.[1][2]In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords.[1][3] Apple’s securityd utility takes the user’s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory. Apple also uses a set of keys and algorithms to encrypt the user’s password, but once the master key is found, an adversary need only iterate over the other values to unlock the final password.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1555.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1555", "Tactic": "Credential Access", "Platforms": "Linux, macOS", "Permissions Required": "root", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "12 February 2020", "Last Modified": "08 March 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0276": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0276", "Keydnap", "Keydnap uses the keychaindump project to read securityd memory.[4]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Process Access": ["Monitor for processes being accessed that may obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain.", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"]}}
