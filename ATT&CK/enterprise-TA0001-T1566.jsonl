{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0001-T1566", "TTP_name": "Phishing", "Description": "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.", "Property": {"ID": "T1566", "Sub-techniques": "T1566.001, T1566.002, T1566.003", "Tactic": "Initial Access", "Platforms": "Google Workspace, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "CAPEC ID": "CAPEC-98", "Contributors": "Philip Winther", "Version": "2.2", "Created": "02 March 2020", "Last Modified": "04 January 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0001": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0001", "Axiom", "Axiom has used spear phishing to initially compromise victims.[1][2]"], "G0115": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0115", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD", "GOLD SOUTHFIELD has conducted malicious spam (malspam) campaigns to gain access to victim's machines.[3]"], "S0009": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0009", "Hikit", "Hikit has been spread through spear phishing.[2]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1049": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1049", "Antivirus/Antimalware", "Anti-virus can automatically quarantine suspicious files."], "M1031": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031", "Network Intrusion Prevention", "Network intrusion prevention systems and systems designed to scan and remove malicious email attachments or links can be used to block activity."], "M1021": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1021", "Restrict Web-Based Content", "Determine if certain websites or attachment types (ex: .scr, .exe, .pif, .cpl, etc.) that can be used for phishing are necessary for business operations and consider blocking access if activity cannot be monitored well or if it poses a significant risk."], "M1054": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1054", "Software Configuration", "Use anti-spoofing and email authentication mechanisms to filter messages based on validity checks of the sender domain (using SPF) and integrity of messages (using DKIM).
