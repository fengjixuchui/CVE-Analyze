{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0040-T1485", "TTP_name": "Data Destruction", "Description": "Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Common operating system file deletion commands such as del and rm often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from Disk Content Wipe and Disk Structure Wipe because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.[4][5] In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.[2][3][4]To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like Valid Accounts, OS Credential Dumping, and SMB/Windows Admin Shares.[1][2][3][4][6].In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.[7][8]", "Property": {"ID": "T1485", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platforms": "IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "Administrator, SYSTEM, User, root", "Impact Type": "Availability", "Contributors": "Brent Murphy, Elastic; David French, Elastic; Prasad Somasamudram, McAfee; Sekhar Sarukkai, McAfee ; Syed Ummar Farooqh, McAfee; Varonis Threat Labs", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "14 March 2019", "Last Modified": "25 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0082": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082", "APT38", "APT38 has used a custom secure delete function to make deleted files unrecoverable.[9]"], "S0089": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0089", "BlackEnergy", "BlackEnergy 2 contains a \"Destroy\" plug-in that destroys data stored on victim hard drives by overwriting file contents.[10][11]"], "S0693": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0693", "CaddyWiper", "CaddyWiper can work alphabetically through drives on a compromised system to take ownership of and overwrite all files.[12][13]"], "S0659": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0659", "Diavol", "Diavol can delete specified files from a targeted system.[14]"], "G0047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047", "Gamaredon Group", "Gamaredon Group has used tools to delete files and folders from victims' desktops and profiles.[15]"], "S0697": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0697", "HermeticWiper", "HermeticWiper can recursively wipe folders and files in Windows, Program Files, Program Files(x86), PerfLogs, Boot, System, Volume Information, and AppData folders using FSCTL_MOVE_FILE.
