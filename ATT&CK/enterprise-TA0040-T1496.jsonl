{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0040-T1496", "TTP_name": "Resource Hijacking", "Description": "Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems in order to solve resource intensive problems, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive.[1] Servers and cloud-based systems are common targets because of the high potential for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining.[2] Containerized environments may also be targeted due to the ease of deployment via exposed APIs and the potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple containers within an environment or cluster.[3][4]Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure it’s not competing for resources.[5]Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate Network Denial of Service campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents.[6]", "Property": {"ID": "T1496", "Sub-techniques": "No sub-techniques", "Tactic": "Impact", "Platforms": "Containers, IaaS, Linux, Windows, macOS", "Impact Type": "Availability", "Contributors": "Alfredo Oliveira, Trend Micro; David Fiser, @anu4is, Trend Micro; Jay Chen, Palo Alto Networks; Magno Logan, @magnologan, Trend Micro; Vishwas Manral, McAfee; Yossi Weizman, Azure Defender Research Team", "Version": "1.3", "Created": "17 April 2019", "Last Modified": "18 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0096": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0096", "APT41", "APT41 deployed a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool in a victim’s environment.[7]"], "G0108": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0108", "Blue Mockingbird", "Blue Mockingbird has used XMRIG to mine cryptocurrency on victim systems.[8]"], "S0486": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0486", "Bonadan", "Bonadan can download an additional module which has a cryptocurrency mining extension.[9]"], "S0492": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0492", "CookieMiner", "CookieMiner has loaded coinmining software onto systems to mine for Koto cryptocurrency.
