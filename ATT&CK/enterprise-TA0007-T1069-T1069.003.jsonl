The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups. The Get-MsolRole PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts [1][2].Azure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups. The command az ad user get-member-groups will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint GET https://cloudidentity.googleapis.com/v1/groups lists group resources available to a user for Google.[3][4][5]Adversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS GetBucketAcl API [6]. Using this information an adversary can target accounts with permissions to a given object or leverage accounts they have already compromised to access the object.", "Property": {"ID": "T1069.003", "Sub-technique of": "T1069", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Azure AD, Google Workspace, IaaS, Office 365, SaaS", "Contributors": "Isif Ibrahima, Mandiant; Regina Elwell", "Version": "1.3", "Created": "21 February 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals can enumerate Azure AD groups.[7]"], "S0684": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0684", "ROADTools", "ROADTools can enumerate Azure AD groups.[8]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Application Log Content": ["Monitor for events collected that may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.", "DS0015", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0015", "Application Log"], "Command Execution": ["Monitor for executed commands and arguments that may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Group Enumeration": ["Monitor for an extracted list of available groups and/or their associated setting", "DS0036", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0036", "Group"], "Group Metadata": ["Contextual data about a group which describes group and activity around it that may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.", "", "", ""], "Process Creation": ["Monitor newly executed processes that may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"]}}
