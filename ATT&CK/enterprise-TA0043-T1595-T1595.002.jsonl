{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0043-T1595-T1595.002", "TTP_name": "Vulnerability Scanning", "Description": "Adversaries may scan victims for vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.These scans may also include more broad attempts to Gather Victim Host Information that can be used to identify more commonly known, exploitable vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans typically harvest running software and version numbers via server banners, listening ports, or other network artifacts.[1] Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Search Open Technical Databases), establishing operational resources (ex: Develop Capabilities or Obtain Capabilities), and/or initial access (ex: Exploit Public-Facing Application).", "Property": {"ID": "T1595.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1595", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "15 April 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has performed large-scale scans in an attempt to find vulnerable servers.[2]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has conducted widespread scanning of target environments to identify vulnerabilities for exploit.[3]"], "G0143": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0143", "Aquatic Panda", "Aquatic Panda has used publicly accessible DNS logging services to identify servers vulnerable to Log4j (CVE 2021-44228).[4]"], "G0035": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035", "Dragonfly", "Dragonfly has scanned targeted systems for vulnerable Citrix and Microsoft Exchange services.[5]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has conducted widespread scanning to identify public-facing systems vulnerable to Log4j (CVE-2021-44228).[6]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has scanned network infrastructure for vulnerabilities as part of its operational planning.[7]"], "G0139": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0139", "TeamTNT", "TeamTNT has scanned for vulnerabilities in IoT devices and other related resources such as the Docker API.[8]"], "G0123": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0123", "Volatile Cedar", "Volatile Cedar has performed vulnerability scans of the target server.[9][10]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
