Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.[1][2][3]Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.", "Property": {"ID": "T1546", "Sub-techniques": "T1546.001, T1546.002, T1546.003, T1546.004, T1546.005, T1546.006, T1546.007, T1546.008, T1546.009, T1546.010, T1546.011, T1546.012, T1546.013, T1546.014, T1546.015", "Tactics": "Privilege Escalation, Persistence", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "22 January 2020", "Last Modified": "08 February 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "File Creation": ["Monitor newly constructed files that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.", "DS0022", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0022", "File"], "File Metadata": ["Monitor for contextual data about a file, which may include information such as name, the content (ex: signature, headers, or data/media), user/ower, permissions, etc.", "", "", ""], "File Modification": ["Monitor for changes made to files that may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.", "", "", ""], "Module Load": ["Monitor DLL loads by processes, specifically looking for DLLs that are not recognized or not normally loaded into a process.
