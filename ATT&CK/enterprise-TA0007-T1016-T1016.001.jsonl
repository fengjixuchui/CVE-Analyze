This may be performed during automated discovery and can be accomplished in numerous ways such as using Ping, tracert, and GET requests to websites.Adversaries may use the results and responses from these requests to determine if the system is capable of communicating with their C2 servers before attempting to connect to them. The results may also be used to identify routes, redirectors, and proxy servers.", "Property": {"ID": "T1016.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1016", "Tactic": "Discovery", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Permissions Required": "User", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "17 March 2021", "Last Modified": "25 March 2021"}, "Examples": {"G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has used GoldFinder to perform HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors that an HTTP request travels through.[1]"], "G0047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0047", "Gamaredon Group", "Gamaredon Group has tested connectivity between a compromised machine and a C2 server using Ping with commands such as CSIDL_SYSTEM\\cmd.exe /c ping -n 1.[2]"], "S0597": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0597", "GoldFinder", "GoldFinder performed HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity and identify HTTP proxy servers and other redirectors that an HTTP request traveled through.[1]"], "S0284": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0284", "More_eggs", "More_eggs has used HTTP GET requests to check internet connectivity.[3]"], "S0691": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0691", "Neoichor", "Neoichor can check for Internet connectivity by contacting bing[.]com with the request format bing[.]com?id=<GetTickCount>.[4]"], "S0650": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0650", "QakBot", "QakBot can measure the download speed on a targeted host.[5]"], "S0686": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0686", "QuietSieve", "QuietSieve can check C2 connectivity with a ping to 8.8.8.8 (Google public DNS).[6]"], "G0010": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010", "Turla", "Turla has used tracert to check internet connectivity.[7]"]}, "Mitigation": {}, "Detection": {"Command Execution": ["Monitor executed commands and arguments that may check for Internet connectivity on compromised systems.", "DS0017", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0017", "Command"], "Process Creation": ["Monitor for executed processes (such as tracert or ping) that may check for Internet connectivity on compromised systems.", "DS0009", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0009", "Process"]}}
