Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-facing email infrastructure and addresses for employees.Adversaries may easily gather email addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex: Social Media or Search Victim-Owned Websites).[1][2] Email addresses could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e. Active Scanning), such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system.[3]Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: Search Open Websites/Domains or Phishing for Information), establishing operational resources (ex: Email Accounts), and/or initial access (ex: Phishing or Brute Force via External Remote Services).", "Property": {"ID": "T1589.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1589", "Tactic": "Reconnaissance", "Platforms": "PRE", "Contributors": "Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC)", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "02 October 2020", "Last Modified": "09 December 2021"}, "Examples": {"S0677": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0677", "AADInternals", "AADInternals can check for the existence of user email addresses using public Microsoft APIs.[4][5]"], "G0050": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0050", "APT32", "APT32 has collected e-mail addresses for activists and bloggers in order to target them with spyware.[6]"], "G0125": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0125", "HAFNIUM", "HAFNIUM has collected e-mail addresses for users they intended to target.[7]"], "G0094": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0094", "Kimsuky", "Kimsuky has collected valid email addresses that were subsequently used in spearphishing campaigns.[8]"], "G0032": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032", "Lazarus Group", "Lazarus Group collected email addresses belonging to various departments of a targeted organization which were used in follow-on phishing campaigns.[9]"], "G0059": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0059", "Magic Hound", "Magic Hound has acquired the personal email addresses of some individuals they intend to target.[10]"], "G0069": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0069", "MuddyWater", "MuddyWater has specifically targeted government agency employees with spearphishing e-mails.[11]"], "G0034": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0034", "Sandworm Team", "Sandworm Team has obtained valid emails addresses while conducting research against target organizations that were subsequently used in spearphishing campaigns.[12]"], "G0122": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0122", "Silent Librarian", "Silent Librarian has collected e-mail addresses from targeted organizations from open Internet searches.[13]"], "G0127": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0127", "TA551", "TA551 has used spoofed company emails that were acquired from email clients on previously infected hosts to target other individuals.[14]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1056": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1056", "Pre-compromise", "This technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventive controls since it is based on behaviors performed outside of the scope of enterprise defenses and controls.
