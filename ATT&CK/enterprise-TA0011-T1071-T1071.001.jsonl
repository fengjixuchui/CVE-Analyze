{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0011-T1071-T1071.001", "TTP_name": "Web Protocols", "Description": "Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.Protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS that carry web traffic may be very common in environments. HTTP/S packets have many fields and headers in which data can be concealed. An adversary may abuse these protocols to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network while also mimicking normal, expected traffic.", "Property": {"ID": "T1071.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1071", "Tactic": "Command and Control", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Version": "1.0", "Created": "15 March 2020", "Last Modified": "26 March 2020"}, "Examples": {"S0066": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0066", "3PARA RAT", "3PARA RAT uses HTTP for command and control.[1]"], "S0065": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0065", "4H RAT", "4H RAT uses HTTP for command and control.[1]"], "S0469": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0469", "ABK", "ABK has the ability to use HTTP in communications with C2.[2]"], "S0045": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0045", "ADVSTORESHELL", "ADVSTORESHELL connects to port 80 of a C2 server using Wininet API.
