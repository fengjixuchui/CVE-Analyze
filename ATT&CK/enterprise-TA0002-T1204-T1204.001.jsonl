Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Link. Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via Exploitation for Client Execution. Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via Malicious File.", "Property": {"ID": "T1204.001", "Sub-technique of": "T1204", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platforms": "Linux,
