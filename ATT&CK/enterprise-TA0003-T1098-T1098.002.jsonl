{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0003-T1098-T1098.002", "TTP_name": "Additional Email Delegate Permissions", "Description": "Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.For example, the Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.[1][2][3] In Google Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users can delegate accounts via their Gmail settings.[4][5]Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles. In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders.[6]This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add Additional Cloud Roles to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex: Internal Spearphishing), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.[7]", "Property": {"ID": "T1098.002", "Sub-technique of": "T1098", "Tactic": "Persistence", "Platforms": "Google Workspace, Office 365, Windows", "Contributors": "Jannie Li, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC); Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART); Mike Burns, Mandiant; Naveen Vijayaraghavan, Nilesh Dherange (Gurucul)", "Version": "2.0", "Created": "19 January 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has used a Powershell cmdlet to grant the ApplicationImpersonation role to a compromised account.[8]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes.
