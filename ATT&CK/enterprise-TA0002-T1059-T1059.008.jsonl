The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands.Scripting interpreters automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS. The CLI and scripting interpreter are accessible through a direct console connection, or through remote means, such as telnet or SSH.Adversaries can use the network CLI to change how network devices behave and operate. The CLI may be used to manipulate traffic flows to intercept or manipulate data, modify startup configuration parameters to load malicious system software, or to disable security features or logging to avoid detection.[1]", "Property": {"ID": "T1059.008", "Sub-technique of": "T1059", "Tactic": "Execution", "Platforms": "Network", "Supports Remote": "Yes", "Version": "1.1", "Created": "20 October 2020", "Last Modified": "19 April 2022"}, "Examples": {}, "Mitigation": {"M1038": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1038", "Execution Prevention", "TACACS+ can keep control over which commands administrators are permitted to use through the configuration of authentication and command authorization.
