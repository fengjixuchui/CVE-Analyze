{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0009-T1213", "TTP_name": "Data from Information Repositories", "Description": "Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Specific common information repositories include web-based platforms such as Sharepoint and Confluence, specific services such as Code Repositories, IaaS databases, enterprise databases, and other storage infrastructure such as SQL Server.", "Property": {"ID": "T1213", "Sub-techniques": "T1213.001, T1213.002, T1213.003", "Tactic": "Collection", "Platforms": "Google Workspace, IaaS, Linux, Office 365, SaaS, Windows, macOS", "Contributors": "Isif Ibrahima, Mandiant; Milos Stojadinovic; Naveen Vijayaraghavan, Nilesh Dherange (Gurucul); Praetorian; Regina Elwell", "Version": "3.2", "Created": "18 April 2018", "Last Modified": "11 April 2022"}, "Examples": {"G0007": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0007", "APT28", "APT28 has collected files from various information repositories.[1]"], "G0016": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0016", "APT29", "APT29 has accessed victimsâ€™ internal knowledge repositories (wikis) to view sensitive corporate information on products, services, and internal business operations.[2]"], "G0037": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0037", "FIN6", "FIN6 has collected schemas and user accounts from systems running SQL Server.[3]"], "G0117": ["https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0117", "Fox Kitten", "Fox Kitten has accessed victim security and IT environments and Microsoft Teams to mine valuable information.[4]"], "S0598": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0598", "P.A.S.

Information repositories generally have a considerably large user base, detection of malicious use can be non-trivial. At minimum, access to information repositories performed by privileged users (for example, Active Directory Domain, Enterprise, or Schema Administrators) should be closely monitored and alerted upon, as these types of accounts should generally not be used to access information repositories. If the capability exists, it may be of value to monitor and alert on users that are retrieving and viewing a large number of documents and pages; this behavior may be indicative of programmatic means being used to retrieve all data within the repository. In environments with high-maturity, it may be possible to leverage User-Behavioral Analytics (UBA) platforms to detect and alert on user based anomalies.", "DS0015", "https://attack.mitre.org/datasources/DS0015", "Application Log"], "Logon Session Creation": ["Monitor for newly constructed logon behavior within Microsoft's SharePoint can be configured to report access to certain pages and documents.
