{"TTP_id": "enterprise-TA0003-T1574", "TTP_name": "Hijack Execution Flow", "Description": "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.", "Property": {"ID": "T1574", "Sub-techniques": "T1574.001, T1574.002, T1574.004, T1574.005, T1574.006, T1574.007, T1574.008, T1574.009, T1574.010, T1574.011, T1574.012, T1574.013", "Tactics": "Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion", "Platforms": "Linux, Windows, macOS", "Defense Bypassed": "Anti-virus, Application Control", "Version": "1.2", "Created": "12 March 2020", "Last Modified": "05 May 2022"}, "Examples": {"S0354": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0354", "Denis", "Denis replaces the nonexistent Windows DLL \"msfte.dll\" with its own malicious version, which is loaded by the SearchIndexer.exe and SearchProtocolHost.exe.[1]"], "S0567": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0567", "Dtrack", "One of Dtrack can replace the normal flow of a program execution with malicious code.[2]"], "S0444": ["https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0444", "ShimRat", "ShimRat can hijack the cryptbase.dll within migwiz.exe to escalate privileges and bypass UAC controls.[3]"]}, "Mitigation": {"M1013": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1013", "Application Developer Guidance", "When possible, include hash values in manifest files to help prevent side-loading of malicious libraries.[4]"], "M1047": ["https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1047", "Audit", "Use auditing tools capable of detecting hijacking opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them.
